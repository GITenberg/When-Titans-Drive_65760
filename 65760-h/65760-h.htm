<h1>WHEN TITANS DRIVE</h1>
<div>Adventures of Bainbridge of Bangor</div>
<div style='margin-top:1em;'>by Burt L. Standish</div>
</div>

<h2>CHAPTER I. STRUCK IN THE NIGHT</h2>

<p>With muscles tense and legs spread wide apart, Bob Bainbridge found himself
crouching in the middle of the office shanty. It was yet dark, and in his ears
still seemed to sound the dull, rumbling detonation which had made him leap from
the bunk before he was even half awake. For a second the stillness was absolute.
Then from the other side of the small room came a hoarse, shaking whisper:</p>

<p><q>Bobby! What the dickens was that?</q></p>

<p>The young man drew a long breath, and an instant later the flame of a match
split the darkness.</p>

<p><q>Don’t know, John,</q> he answered, hastily lighting a candle. <q>It sounded a lot
like&mdash;dynamite!</q></p>

<p>He set the candle down on a rough table, and, reaching for one high, spiked
shoe, began swiftly to drag it on. From the bunk across the room came a stifled
gasp of dismay, and a short, stout, middle-aged man with a heavy, square face
and deep-set blue eyes rolled forth into the uncertain, wavering light, and sat
for an instant staring at his companion.</p>

<p><q>Dynamite!</q> he repeated, in a tone of consternation. <q>You don’t mean
to say&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>I don’t mean to say anything,</q> was the crisp reply, as Bainbridge tied the
leather lacings with a jerk, and reached for the other shoe. <q>I only know it
sounded like dynamite to me, and people don’t usually set that off at three in
the morning&mdash;for fun.</q></p>

<p>John Tweedy delayed no longer. With an agility surprising in one so bulky, he
fairly flung himself at the pile of outer garments lying on a near-by box, and
when Bainbridge, a couple of minutes later, jerked open the door to plunge forth
into the night, the stout man was close at his heels.</p>

<p>Quickly as they had acted, there were others equally swift. The windows of
the big bunk house across the clearing glowed faintly, and they had no more than
reached the open before the door was flung wide to eject a crowd of men fully
dressed in the garb of the lumber country. They were headed by Griggs, foreman
of the drive. Tall, lean, with a tanned, impassive countenance which betrayed
nothing, he glanced for a second toward the approaching pair, and then fell into
step with Bainbridge.</p>

<p><q>Well?</q> queried the latter crisply. <q>What is it, Harvey? The dam?</q></p>

<p>The foreman’s eyes narrowed, and, under the drooping lids, seemed to gleam
dully.</p>

<p><q>I don’t know what else,</q> he said. <q>Listen!</q></p>

<p>For a second Bainbridge stood still, head thrust slightly forward in the
direction of his foreman’s pointing finger. Behind him was the thud and clatter
of men still pouring from the bunk house, mingled with the bustle of those
already in the open, chafing at the delay, and impatient to reach the scene of
action. The wind was blowing half a gale from the north, but above it all could
be heard&mdash;faintly, intermittently&mdash;the distant, ominous roar of rushing
water.</p>

<p>It brought Bob’s teeth together with a click, but not in time to cut off a
savage exclamation. Then he turned and started down the slope toward the south,
followed closely by the entire crowd.</p>

<p>The hillside was dotted thick with stumps and great piles of tops and
<q>slashings.</q> The resinous, green, unwithered masses of pine branches, as well as
the whiteness of stump ends and scattered chips, showed the cutting to have been
lately done. It had, in fact, been completed scarcely a month before; the last
load of timber had been sent down the short, narrow stream to Chebargo Lake
within the past twelve hours. And at the thought of that great drive of logs,
held in place by the many booms until the moment came for it to be sent down the
river to the mills, Bob’s jaw hardened, and his face took on an expression of
tense anxiety and suspense.</p>

<p>Still he did not speak. Griggs was at one elbow, Tweedy at the other, both
puffing a little, but moving with unexpected ease and agility. Behind, at a
lope, came the throng of husky woodsmen.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill Bainbridge swerved sharply to the left along the
narrow stream. A space had been cleared through the undergrowth for a rough road
diversified by protruding roots and bowlders, bog holes and stretches of
corduroy leading across swampy places. The rush of water sounded clearer now,
and more distinct, and presently, unable longer to restrain himself, Bob broke
into a run.</p>

<p>Up and down slopes and hillocks, in and out of hard-wood groves he sped.
Behind him the thud of many feet pounding on the frozen ground mingled with
quickening breaths and an occasional muttered imprecation. Then suddenly the
whole crowd, racing up the side of a knoll which overlooked the upper end of the
lake, stopped abruptly with an odd, concerted gasp.</p>

<p>Below them lay the lake bed&mdash;for it was a lake no longer. In spite of the
darkness, the starlight showed Bainbridge quite enough to make him give a low
groan of dismay and fury.</p>

<p>The lake was an artificial one some two miles long by three-quarters wide,
formed for the purpose of facilitating the handling of Bainbridge &amp; Tweedy’s
huge Chebargo cut. The dam had been constructed only the summer before under
Bob’s personal supervision, and was equipped with the latest thing in patent
locked gates to prevent any possible meddling with the head of water.</p>

<p>Evidently, however, these had proved insufficient in the present instance.
Out in the center of the lake bed a swiftly diminishing flow of water was
vanishing toward the dam. In five minutes at most nothing would be left save
the narrow, crooked stream curving between slopes of mud. Along the face of
these slopes sprawled the massive, useless booms of logs which had been designed
and constructed to hold in check the great drive of timber that now towered over
and behind them, stranded high and dry beyond the possibility of human
interference.</p>

<p>Bob paused here only a minute or two before starting on toward the location
of the dam. He realized perfectly the futility of such a move. He knew as well
as if they were looking upon the ruin that the dam had been destroyed or
rendered utterly useless. The mere opening of the gates could have no such
far-reaching effect as this. Nevertheless, he felt that he must see it with his
own eyes before he could bring himself to plan for the future. And so he kept
on.</p>

<p>He was right, of course. They found the concrete structure utterly ruined.
More than half its surface had been blown away, leaving a great, gaping, ragged
fissure through which the water must have rushed, a veritable flood. Long before
that could be repaired the spring freshets would have ceased entirely. It would
be a physical impossibility to bring the head of water back to its original
level until next season. The great drive of finest white pine stranded back in
that mudhole was doomed to lie there a prey to rot and destructive boring
insects for the better part of a twelvemonth, and in the end was quite likely to
prove an almost total loss.</p>

<p>Such a catastrophe would be a serious blow to any firm, no matter how great
their resources might be. To a concern whose credit had already been strained
almost to the breaking point, it would quite likely mean ruin.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER II. THE INDOMITABLE SPIRIT</h2>

<p><q>My country!</q> gasped Tweedy, suddenly clenching a fat fist, and shaking it
fiercely. <q>Sixty thousand dollars gone to pot! How in thunder can you stand
there, Bobby, and not say a word? Don’t you realize that near half our season’s
work is lost? That timber can’t be got out this year any way you think of, an’
by next spring the logs’ll be so full o’ worms they won’t be worth touching
hardly. It’s Crane and his gang that’s put one over on us! The trust’s been
after us ever since you started that reform racket, and now they’ve got us
good!</q></p>

<p>The stout man fairly choked in the excess of his fury, thrusting a purpling
face close to Bainbridge’s.</p>

<p><q>It’s sixty thousand dollars as good as thrown into the gutter,</q> he
sputtered. <q>For the love of Heaven, Bobby, can’t you wake up and say
something?</q></p>

<p>The young man’s gaze turned slowly from where it had been resting
thoughtfully on that last wrecked boom with the shadowy masses of logs sprawling
behind it, and he moved his shoulders impatiently.</p>

<p><q>What’s the use in saying anything until there’s something to say?</q> he
inquired, with some tartness. <q>I’m not quite a fool, John. I know Crane’s turned
a rotten trick, which is going to cripple us badly. I’m trying to think of a way
out.</q></p>

<p><q>Humph!</q> granted Tweedy despondently. <q>There ain’t any that I can see. I tell
you, son, every penny of that sixty is gone beyond the reach of anybody.</q></p>

<p><q>Not quite,</q> Bob said curtly, turning to Griggs. <q>What’s it cost a thousand
to bark white pine, Harvey? About a dollar, isn’t it?</q></p>

<p><q>Round that,</q> nodded the foreman.</p>

<p><q>That cuts out any danger from borers, doesn’t it?</q> Bainbridge continued
Bob’s eyes narrowed, and his well-shaped mouth grew firmer. He glanced again at
Tweedy, and raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p><q>That’s all there is left for us to do&mdash;eh, John?</q> he said quickly, and even
the not particularly sensitive Tweedy was aware of a ringing undercurrent in his
voice. <q>We’ll bark ’em at once, and I’ll send down to Bangor for men and
material to repair the dam. Harvey will look after all that, and we’ll save
three-quarters, at least, of the value of the drive, in spite of Crane’s dirty
work.</q></p>

<p><q>That may be true enough,</q> retorted the older man dispiritedly, <q>but do you
realize what it’s going to mean to lose the use of that capital for a whole
year?</q></p>

<p>He stepped closer to his young partner, and lowered his voice to a
whisper:</p>

<p><q>You know the condition we’re in financially, Bob. This campaign of yours
against graft has cost us money&mdash;bunches of it. Our resources have never been so
low. This loss is going to cripple us in a way which even the officials of the
trust, with all their means of finding out things, can’t guess. It may be
impossible even to get credit, and I don’t see how on earth we’re going to get
through the year without something&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>We’ve got to!</q> Bob’s voice was hard and determined. <q>Can’t you see that’s
just what Crane’s after? He’s done this to draw our sting and leave us helpless.
We’ll have to weather the storm somehow, John. I’ll be hanged if I’ll let that
crowd of crooks have their way. We’ve got the biggest stock of manufactured
lumber in years&mdash;that’s one good thing. The other is our Megantic drive. Once
that’s down at the mills we ought to be in fair shape, and able to tell our
esteemed former partner and his crowd to go to&mdash;Halifax.</q></p>

<p>But Tweedy refused to brace up and look upon the bright side. Instead of
being cheered and encouraged by Bob’s optimistic manner and fighting spirit, his
frown deepened, and his lips drooped still farther at the corners.</p>

<p><q>Once it’s at the mills&mdash;yes,</q> he retorted significantly. <q>What guarantee
have we got that it’ll ever get there? You don’t suppose for a minute they’re
going to let that alone, do you, after what they’ve done here?</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge flung back his head, his dark eyes glittering.</p>

<p><q>No, but they’re welcome to try their darndest!</q> he exclaimed. <q>They can’t
turn any such trick as this, and I mean to start for the Megantic camp as soon
as day breaks. I’ll stick with that drive till the last log is safe in our mill
booms, and if the gang tries any more dirty work there’ll be something doing,
believe me! You’d better beat it down to Bangor and arrange about credit. You
can do it, somehow. It’s going to be a fight to the finish, John, and I reckon
they’ll find out before it’s over that we’re not quite the easy marks they seem
to think.</q></p>

<p>Tweedy made no reply save a pessimistic hunch of his pudgy shoulders. It
seemed to him that Bainbridge was decidedly underestimating the extent of the
damage done them by the treachery of those cowardly miscreants who, though
actually unknown, could not possibly be other than tools of the hostile and
unscrupulous Lumber Trust.</p>

<p>For practically the entire winter the firm had been pouring out money in
wages, supplies, and equipment, expecting to clean up large and immediate
profits from as fine a lot of timber as either of the lumbermen had ever seen.
To have the entire drive suddenly stranded in this manner was like losing every
cent which had been paid out, for Tweedy was not at all sure that anything could
be saved from the wreck. He had no great faith in the efficacy of barking. It
seemed like throwing good money after bad, and he said as much in very decided
terms when they were back in the office shanty making hurried preparations for
instant departure.</p>

<p>He was overruled, however, by both Bainbridge and Griggs, who were quite
certain the logs could be saved at an expenditure of about a fifth of their
value. And since Bob was in charge of the woods end of the business, the older
man was forced to give in.</p>

<p>There followed, during a hasty breakfast, a brief consultation regarding the
steps Tweedy should take toward getting additional credit, at the same time
doing his best, of course, to sell at once some of their big stock of
manufactured lumber. Griggs was given instructions as to the method of working
and the number of men to keep. Then came a hurried farewell between the two
partners.</p>

<p>The sun had scarcely risen above the fringe of trees around the camp before
Tweedy was being driven rapidly toward the nearest railroad station, while Bob,
accompanied only by Joe Moose, an Indian guide, was sitting in the stern of a
canoe, paddling steadily up Chebargo Stream.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER III. MORE TREACHERY</h2>

<p>The Megantic drive, starting from a point some forty miles northwest of
Chebargo, was already in motion. Its course would be down the Megantic Stream
through several ponds and lakes into the Katahdin River, and thence down the
Penobscot to the mills at Bangor.</p>

<p>By paddling upstream and making three portages of less than a mile each,
Bainbridge and the guide cut off a lot of distance, and struck the Megantic
between the second and third lake toward three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>Knowing when Pete Schaeffer, the drive boss, had started, Bob calculated that
he would have advanced considerably beyond this point, and turned the canoe
downstream, keeping a close lookout along the banks for signs which would
inevitably be left by a great drive.</p>

<p>The country was rough and wild, the stream boiling and tumbling between
rather high, rocky banks. Presently, however, these gave place to lower, muddy
stretches, which bore no single trace of stranded logs, or the tracks made by
the rear crew following along behind a big drive and <q>sacking</q> the River.</p>

<p>It took Bob very little time to make certain of this, and his heavy, dark
brows came suddenly together above the bridge of his well-shaped nose, a single,
emphatic line.</p>

<p><q>The drive hasn’t passed,</q> he said abruptly, thrusting his paddle straight
down by the side of the canoe, and stopping the frail craft instantly.</p>

<p>The Indian moved slightly, and turned a copper-colored profile over one
shoulder.</p>

<p><q>Him held up above,</q> he suggested. <q>Mebbe jam.</q></p>

<p><q>Jam!</q> repeated Bainbridge sharply. <q>Why should there be a jam? The stream’s
straight and wide enough, with a fine head of water. The hard parts come farther
down. With a boss on the job, and halfway attending to business, the drive ought
to be down as far as Loon Lake by this time.</q></p>

<p>Still frowning, he gave a wide, powerful sweep of his paddle, which headed
the canoe upstream.</p>

<p><q>Besides,</q> he went on, as the craft danced along under the impetus of their
sturdy, practiced strokes, <q>Schaeffer’s had time to break up half a dozen
ordinary jams. He’s no fool, and he knows his business as well as any man in the
country. He knows this high water can’t last much longer, and that we’re
altogether dependent on it till we reach the Penobscot. If he&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p>A sudden extremely unpleasant thought made the speaker break off abruptly,
with a swift catching of his breath. His frown deepened into a scowl, and a
touch of angry red glowed under the clear, healthy tan of his clean-cut
face.</p>

<p><q>Mebbe him no care about making hurry,</q> remarked the Indian coolly, without
even glancing around. <q>Mebbe him like to see drive hang up.</q></p>

<p>The extraordinary manner in which the guide’s comment chimed in with his own
mental process fairly took Bob’s breath away. He hesitated for an instant,
wondering whether the Indian knew anything special or whether his remark had
been prompted by mere guesswork. Knowing Moose for many years, Bainbridge had
never been quite able to determine whether the man was attached to him
personally, as sometimes in his stolid, self-restrained manner he seemed to be.
It was more likely to be simply the canny shrewdness of the native knowing on
which side his bread was buttered. At all events, Bob had never counted on it to
the extent of any great familiarity, though, under the conditions in which they
were frequently alone together in the woods, he could scarcely help letting down
the bars a little.</p>

<p><q>What makes you say that?</q> he asked, suddenly making up his mind. <q>What
earthly reason could Pete Schaeffer have for wanting to see the drive hang up?
He’s been offered a bonus for every extra day he gains in landing the logs at
the mill booms.</q></p>

<p>The square, buckskin-covered shoulders hunched again, <q>Mebbe not offer
’nuff,</q> retorted the Indian stolidly. <q>Mebbe he get more to hang up drive.</q></p>

<p><q>Who the deuce are you talking about, Joe?</q> inquired Bainbridge crisply, <q>Who
would pay him to play a dirty trick like that?</q></p>

<p>The guide slowly turned his head, and regarded Bob with a sort of impassive
significance.</p>

<p><q>Big Punch know who,</q> he retorted briefly.</p>

<p><q>Perhaps I do, perhaps not.</q> Bob’s tone was decidedly impatient. <q>Anyhow,
let’s have the name, and see if we agree.</q></p>

<p><q>Huh!</q> grunted Moose wearily. <q>Him Crane. Pete, he great friends with Crane’s
man, K’lock.</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge’s jaw dropped, and unconsciously he drove his paddle deep down
into the current, checking the canoe for a moment or two.</p>

<p><q>Bill Kollock!</q> he exploded, in angry amazement. <q>Do you know what you’re
talking about, Joe?</q></p>

<p>The Indian grinned faintly.</p>

<p><q>Sure! Joe see ’em in s’loon in Bangor heap many times. Ver’ friendly. Come
to Pete’s camp yonder five&mdash;six days ago, see K’lock goin’ away.</q></p>

<p>Bob’s face was scarlet with rage, and the eyes fastened upon the guide’s
impassive countenance flashed.</p>

<p><q>You did, did you?</q> he cried angrily. <q>Why didn’t you tell me, then? You talk
a lot about being a friend of mine. Why didn’t you put me wise to all this
before?</q></p>

<p><q>Big Punch no ask of K’lock,</q> replied the Indian, <q>Joe think he no care.
Think he pull K’lock’s stinger last month when find him out.</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge’s lips parted for a vitriolic retort, closed with a snap, and he
resumed his paddling in silence. After all, the fellow was not to blame for
possessing the characteristic Indian quality of reticence. Knowing his habit of
wandering all over the northern part of the state, Bob should have questioned
him the instant the Indian set foot in Chebargo camp the day before.</p>

<p>But questioned him for what purpose? Up to five minutes ago not the slightest
suspicion of Pete Schaeffer had ever entered his employer’s head. The man had
worked for them a number of years. He was quiet and taciturn, sometimes almost
sullen; but few woodsmen have much to say for themselves. He had proved himself
more than competent, and was apparently faithful to the interests of those who
paid his wages.</p>

<p><q>Faithful so long as it suited his purpose and no longer!</q> said Bainbridge
under his breath, <q>The minute the trust gets after him to do its dirty work he’s
perfectly willing to knife us. I can hardly wait to get at the cur!</q></p>

<p>He was obliged to postpone that gratification a good deal longer than he had
expected, however. Though they strained every effort, and sent the canoe fairly
flying upstream, the sun sank lower and lower, without the slightest sign of the
drive appearing.</p>

<p>With every thousand feet of progress Bob grew more raging. When at length the
sun dipped behind the cold, gray, distant hill line, he was filled with a hot,
furious anger against the treacherous Schaeffer&mdash;an anger which needed every
ounce of will power he possessed to suppress.</p>

<p>Determined to find the drive, and have a settlement that night, he stubbornly
continued to paddle long after darkness had fallen, and when they could not see
much more than a boat length in any direction. At length, however, there was
forced upon him a realization of his folly. It would be much wiser to land now
and camp, continuing the journey at daybreak, rather than try to make headway
through this pitchy blackness.</p>

<p>Still reluctant to pause, Bob milled this over in his mind for ten minutes or
more before finally giving the word to Moose, who had made no comment of any
sort. The Indian obeyed stolidly, driving the canoe toward the right bank.
Within five minutes the two men were hunting dry sticks for a fire.</p>

<p>Later, as he sat relaxed before the grateful blaze, consuming the rough
supper with an appetite which only life in those wonderful north woods can give,
Bainbridge remained preoccupied, his forehead wrinkled thoughtfully, and his
brooding eyes fixed upon the dancing flames.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER IV. THE JAM ON MEGANTIC</h2>

<p>There was no time lost either in turning in that night or in rising next
morning. So early was Bainbridge astir that the cold, gray half-light dawn had
barely begun to lighten the velvety blackness. The two men had embarked and were
paddling vigorously upstream before it was possible to see more than the vague,
indistinct shadows of concrete things.</p>

<p>Bob’s rage at the treachery of his trusted drive boss had not lessened
greatly. There was mingled with it, however, a bitter hatred for the man higher
up, and a dogged determination not only to thwart Elihu Crane in his attempt to
ruin the independent firm, but to carry the war into the enemies’ camp with a
zest and vim which his more or less impersonal blocking of the Lumber Trust’s
game had hitherto lacked.</p>

<p>Before sunrise they had reached and crossed the first of the three lakes,
which was little more than a good-sized pond. Two miles northwest of the inlet
another stream, almost as large, joined the Megantic. The juncture was scarcely
passed before Bainbridge became aware of the slackening current, and unnaturally
low level of water in the stream. Something was holding it back, and that
something could be nothing less than a jam of unusual size and extent.</p>

<p>Bob’s eyes narrowed ominously, and three deep, vertical lines flashed
suddenly into view above the straight nose. Downstream there were several spots
which had always been more or less dreaded by river drivers. There all the skill
and care in the world could not always prevent trouble. To the northward,
however, was comparatively clear sailing. The most ordinary skill in driving,
and just average attention to business would make the forming of a jam
impossible.</p>

<p>Bob set his teeth, and drove the canoe ahead swiftly. He made no comment, nor
did the guide. For ten minutes or so they paddled in silence. Bainbridge was
quite aware that under ordinary conditions such a proceeding would have been
foolhardy to a degree. For all he knew the jam might be started at any moment;
the swirling, tumbling logs might sweep down upon them with irresistible force,
overwhelming them before they could even reach the shore. But these were not
ordinary conditions. Having allowed the jam to form with malicious intent, there
was not one chance in a hundred of Schaeffer’s doing anything to break it unless
absolutely forced to.</p>

<p>Events proved the accuracy of this judgment. Some three miles above the
juncture of the two streams the Megantic curved suddenly to the westward almost
at a right angle, narrowing around the bend to less than two-thirds its usual
width. It was at this narrow spot that Bainbridge expected to find the jam, and
before they had circled the bend he saw above the low fringe of bushes on the
point the jagged, bristling line of logs thrust high above the surface of the
choked and dwindling stream by the tremendous pressure of well-nigh the whole
drive behind it.</p>

<p>There was not the slightest hint of hesitation or indecision in the manner of
Bainbridge now. He had evidently made up his mind exactly what course to take,
and he proceeded to take it without delay. His face was no longer impatient or
angry, but stern and determined, while his black eyes gleamed with satisfaction
that the tedious delay was over at last and he could begin to act.</p>

<p>Speaking briefly in a low tone to the Indian, he turned the canoe inshore and
drove the bow deftly up on the gently sloping bank. Giving Moose a hand in
carrying the light craft well back into the bushes, Bainbridge straightened up
and pushed through the undergrowth toward the scene of action.</p>

<p>From the location of the jam came the sound of intermittent clinking, as of
peavies languidly applied. Mingled with it was a vast deal of loud talk and
raucous laughter which brought Bob’s lips together tightly, and made him flush
darkly under his tan. He uttered not a word of comment, even to himself. His
muscular fists were clenched as he strode on.</p>

<p>Though he made not the slightest effort at concealment, conditions were such
that his approach was entirely unnoticed. Passing swiftly through the bushes,
with the Indian close behind, he reached the other side and paused for a moment,
staring intently at the scene before him.</p>

<p>From this viewpoint the jam looked much more serious and far-reaching than
from below. It seemed like some huge abatis bristling with spikes, and holding
in place a vast expanse of tumbled timber piled up and mingled together in
inextricable confusion. A greenhorn, unused to lumbering conditions, would have
said at once that no human power could possibly break up this terrific tangle.
Bainbridge’s practiced eye, ranging swiftly from right to left, and back again
to the breast of the jam, saw instantly that affairs were serious indeed, but
far from being hopeless.</p>

<p>He looked for Schaeffer, but at first he could see nothing of the person who
was supposed to have charge of operations. There were in sight some seventy or
eighty men, fully half of whom were gathered on the near bank, lounging in
groups, laughing; talking, smoking, or sprawling at full length in the sun,
luxuriating in its increasing warmth. Scattered over the jam were the remainder
of the crew, making a half-hearted pretense at working which could not possibly
deceive any one. As he watched one after another of them dally with a peavey in
an indolent, purposeless kind of way, smoking a cigarette the while, and
carrying on a jocular sort of repartee with neighbors, Bainbridge felt swelling
within him the fury he had so long suppressed, but which seemed now as if it
must find expression.</p>

<p>He was about to step impetuously from the undergrowth, and wake up that crowd
with a volley of vigorous English, when a figure appeared at the entrance of one
of the tents pitched a little way back from the water. At the sight of this
person the watcher held himself motionless, a gleam of intense satisfaction
flashing into his eyes.</p>

<p>The man was tall and lean and narrow-loined, with wide, muscular shoulders.
His face was rather rough hewn, and the heavy black brows gave him a lowering,
almost sullen look. There was, however, no lack of strength and intelligence of
a certain sort in his expression. One would never have called him stupid, even
though his appearance might not seem particularly prepossessing.</p>

<p>He stood for a second or two staring at the jam and that throng of men
playing at work, without changing his expression a particle. Then he strolled
slowly down toward the crowd, hands thrust into his pockets, and lithe body
swaying easily from side to side in the manner of one having all the time there
is.</p>

<p>His course led him along the edge of the bushes, and Bainbridge waited his
coming with poorly restrained impatience. The man’s complacency infuriated him,
and yet he was wise enough to realize that now was the time of all others when
it was absolutely necessary to hold himself in hand. He stood there, lips
tightly pressed together, and nails digging into the palms of his hands, until
the foreman was almost opposite. Then he stepped suddenly forth.</p>

<p><q>I seem to have arrived at a very opportune moment, Schaeffer,</q> he said.</p>

<p>The man gave a barely perceptible start, and stopped with a jerk. For an
instant he stared at Bainbridge, the dull red creeping slowly up from the open
collar of his flannel shirt. Then his thin curled in a smile which held little
mirth in it.</p>

<p><q>Quite a surprise you’ve given us, Mr. Bainbridge,</q> he drawled, <q>Didn’t
expect you around for a week yet.</q></p>

<p>Bob’s eyes blazed dangerously, but his voice was steady and cold as ice.</p>

<p><q>That’s very evident,</q> he retorted curtly, with a swift side glance at the
jam.</p>

<p>Schaeffer moved his shoulders slightly and his lids drooped a little.
Otherwise he entirely ignored Bainbridge’s meaning.</p>

<p><q>Yes, we got in a bit o’ trouble here,</q> he said coolly; <q>but it ain’t
anything very serious. Now that the boys are all here to git after it, we’ll
have her pullin’ in great shape before you can say Jack Robinson.</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge took a single step forward, bringing his flushed and angry face
close to Schaeffer.</p>

<p><q>Don’t think for a minute you can bluff me with that sort of rot, Schaeffer,</q>
he said, in a voice which held in it the essence of concentrated fury. <q>I’ve
been standing here for ten minutes watching what’s going on out there. I never
yet had a man who was fool enough to let a drive hang up at this bend unless he
wanted to. Get me? I’m wise to everything, and the sooner you pack your duffle
bag and beat it out of here the better it’ll be for you.</q></p>

<p>Schaeffer’s face had turned a brick red, and his eyes were glittering
dangerously. For a second Bainbridge thought the man meant to pour out a furious
stream of profane abuse. Instead of that, however, he turned suddenly, and his
gaze swept keenly over the throng of men, each one of who had become aware of
the newcomer’s presence, and was watching the altercation with frank curiosity
and interest.</p>

<p><q>So I’m fired, am I?</q> inquired Schaeffer, in an oddly gentle voice, and
without glancing at Bainbridge. <q>Fired without a chance to say a word in my own
defense?</q></p>

<p><q>You are!</q> retorted Bob crisply. <q>As for saying anything in your own defense,
you may as well save your breath. I haven’t the time or the inclination to
listen to lies. You’ve played the traitor and been found out, and if anybody
ever asks why I let you go they’ll get the truth&mdash;no more, no less.</q></p>

<p><q>That so?</q> murmured Schaeffer, idly moving a small pebble with the toe of his
heavy, spiked shoe. <q>I wonder, now?</q></p>

<p>Without the slightest warning or preliminary movement of any sort, he whirled
and smashed Bob square in the face with every ounce of strength he possessed.
Bainbridge, staggered by the force and unexpectedness of it, stumbled back,
tripped, and struck the ground with a crash. The drive boss leaped forward, his
face distorted with passion, and delivered a fierce, slashing kick straight at
the prostrate man’s groin.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER V. FIGHTING FOUL</h2>

<p>Half stunned though he was, Bob still had the wit to fling himself swiftly to
one side, and he did so with such quick, intuitive agility that the long, sharp
spikes of Schaeffer’s shoe barely grazed the flesh of his thigh.</p>

<p>Bob Bainbridge’s brain was cleared with the thoroughness and rapidity of an
electric shock. He leaped to his feet just as the foreman tripped over Joe
Moose’s deftly extended foot, and crashed headlong to the ground.</p>

<p><q>Get up, you cur!</q> cried Bainbridge, as he jerked off the encumbering
Mackinaw and tossed it from him. <q>Get up and take what’s coming to you!</q></p>

<p>He was filled with the sudden, fierce, elemental joy of physical combat. For
what seemed an eternity he had been holding himself in check by sheer will
power, and now the relief of handling with bare fists this fellow who had played
such a contemptible trick upon him was indescribable.</p>

<p>Schaeffer was on his feet like a cat, and came at Bainbridge with a rush. Bob
side-stepped, swinging with his right at the drive boss’ ribs. To his
astonishment the blow was blocked with the cleverness of a professional. An
instant later Schaeffer whirled like a Dervish, and again his opponent felt the
tearing of those spikes in the flesh of his left leg as he went staggering to
both knees.</p>

<p>The surprise of discovering that Schaeffer could box scientifically was
undoubtedly what checked Bob, and gave the fellow a chance to get in that second
foul kick. The touch of those spikes, the realization that a man who could fight
fairly and squarely was low enough to resort to such disgraceful tactics, made
Bainbridge see red. Whether the Indian interfered again in his behalf he could
not tell. He only knew that he was on his feet once more, fighting
instinctively, and fairly overwhelming his opponent with a series of rushes
which there was no withstanding. Schaeffer blocked them as best he could,
depending a lot on clever footwork, and waited for his chance. It seemed certain
that Bainbridge would soon let up and take things easier, and then it would be
possible for the tricky riverman to use some of the other fouls of which he
seemed to be a master.</p>

<p>The moment Bob came to his senses he did cut down his steam considerably. No
human being could keep up that speed for any length of time and hope for
victory, and Bainbridge meant to be victorious in this struggle. Even though
Schaeffer possessed the skill of a champion, he must be beaten in some way, for
the thought of succumbing to a treacherous cur like this was intolerable.</p>

<p>The fight which followed was a strange one. Bainbridge had never known
anything like it in all his varied experience as a boxer. His opponent possessed
exceptional skill in the art; he would, in fact, have been a hard man to defeat
in the conventional ring. Add to this a knowledge of fouling which was simply
extraordinary, and it will be seen what sort of an antagonist he was.</p>

<p>The mere mental strain involved was exhausting. Not only had Bob the thousand
legitimate devices of the ring to look out for, but he never knew when to expect
a vicious jab below the belt, or a nasty butt from the head. And always in the
back of his mind was a fear that those murderous spikes might at any moment
strike deeply, maimingly at the vital spot for which they had been aimed twice
before.</p>

<p>By this time, of course, every <q>river hog</q> within sight had raced up, and the
combatants were surrounded by a ring of eager spectators, several deep, which
swayed and moved and billowed out elastically as the fight progressed. A number
of them were evidently in sympathy with Schaeffer, and kept urging him to go in
and win, but the majority remained silent save for occasional muttered
ejaculations when a particularly clever or vicious blow struck home. Moose, his
small black eyes glistening, but otherwise as stolid and unmoved as ever,
managed constantly to retain his position in the front row.</p>

<p>For a long time Bainbridge kept his opponent in hand. Always the strain of
waiting, expecting, planning to meet the unknown foul, was uppermost in his
mind, to the exclusion of almost everything else. He knew in an intuitive sort
of way that he was fighting well. He had landed several blows which staggered
the man, and the fellow’s face, from which Bob never for an instant withdrew his
eyes, was cut and bleeding. That proved little, however. He was evidently the
sort that could take any amount of punishment, and come up for more. His wind
seemed to be quite as good as Bob’s, and at length the latter was conscious of a
single flash of doubt regarding the issue.</p>

<p>What if he should not win, as he had determined in the beginning? What if
Schaeffer should, by fair means or foul, manage to knock him out? It would not
be like an ordinary knock-out&mdash;simply the end of a fairly fought contest to
decide which of two men is the better scrapper. He would be helpless for a
space, and in the power of this cur who had thus far stopped at nothing. Moose
could accomplish little on his behalf when opposed by the crowd of spectators,
all of whom seemed, from what Bainbridge had caught of their comments, to be on
Schaeffer’s side.</p>

<p>The thought of what might happen was not a pleasant one, and possibly it was
that which led to Bainbridge’s undoing. He had so far instinctively avoided
clinches as being favorable to fouls, but now, with his mind for a second
partially distracted, after delivering a left-hand jab he did not spring back as
swiftly as he might have done. The riverman took instant advantage of the
chance, and leaped forward, gripping Bob’s wrist. In an instant Bainbridge had
wrenched it away, but not too soon to prevent that close contact which he felt
to be so dangerous.</p>

<p><q>He’ll try something dirty now,</q> flashed through Bob’s brain. <q>I knew it! No,
you don’t&mdash;now.</q></p>

<p>Just in time he saw Schaeffer’s left knee suddenly jerked up and forward.
Like a flash he leaped to one side, his whole mind intent on thwarting the
intended trick, and so he fell for a move which would never ordinarily have
bothered him.</p>

<p>A clenched fist, hard and compact almost as a stone, thudded solidly on the
very point of his jaw. Bainbridge went suddenly limp, slipping noiselessly to
the ground.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER VI. THE FINISH UNEXPECTED</h2>

<p>As Bob toppled forward and lay still, a long, deep, concerted sigh of
released tension arose from the spectators, followed by a chorus of admiring
commendation. These rough-and-ready river hogs saw nothing unfair in their
foreman’s method of fighting. The woods’ rules of combat are simple. <q>Get your
man,</q> is the principle one. The manner of getting does not count.</p>

<p><q>Nice work, Pete!</q> called one. <q>Pretty!</q></p>

<p><q>Good for you, old buck! You put him to sleep fine!</q></p>

<p>Schaeffer made no reply to these comments; in fact, it is doubtful if he
heard them. His face, torn and bleeding in many places, bore an expression of
utter savagery. His cut lips were drawn back over sharp teeth in a bestial
snarl. His fists were clenched tightly, and every muscle was tense as he stood
glaring down with hate-filled, bloodshot eyes at the body of his fallen
opponent.</p>

<p><q>You meddling dog!</q> he snarled viciously, after a momentary silence. <q>Thought
you could lick me, did you? Thought you could put one over on me, you skunk!
Well, you got yours, an’ I ain’t done with you yet, not by a long shot!</q></p>

<p>He took a single swift step toward the prostrate man. It was plain to every
one that he meant to drive that heavy, spiked boot again and again at the
helpless body, yet not one of the rivermen uttered a word of protest. A number
of faces expressed disapproval, but in the big woods if a man chooses to end a
combat in this manner it isn’t etiquette to interfere.</p>

<p>Schaeffer paused beside the prostrate figure for a second or two, as if to
prolong his pleasurable anticipation. Then, with a sudden snarl of returning
fury, he swiftly drew back one foot.</p>

<p><q>Stop!</q></p>

<p>The word which came snapping across the circle held in it so much of the
essence of command that the riverman obeyed instinctively; obeyed, and then,
realizing what he had done, foamed with a fresh fury.</p>

<p><q>Why, you copper-colored whelp!</q> he exploded, glaring darkly at the
imperturbable redskin. <q>Wait! When I get through with this junk here&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, and drew his breath with a whistling sound. Joe Moose
was moving leisurely toward him, a most efficient-looking revolver pointed
casually at the riverman’s stomach. He halted within a few feet of Schaeffer,
and stood regarding him with that cool, expressionless stare which was so
characteristic. On the ground between them Bainbridge gave a low groan, and
moved his head uneasily from side to side.</p>

<p><q>Fight not finish,</q> remarked the Indian blandly, <q>Bell go clang, like in
ring. Heap soon Big Punch get up, start ’nother round. Get me, Steve?</q></p>

<p>Schaeffer took an involuntary step backward, his face distorted.</p>

<p><q>Somebody get busy an’ put this lunatic out o’ business,</q> he roared, glaring
around at the ring of interested faces. <q>Bury a lead slug in his worthless
carcass where it’ll do the most good.</q></p>

<p>The guide was bending over his friend, vigorously chafing one limp hand.</p>

<p><q>Better not,</q> he advised coolly, without raising his eyes. <q>Joe’s gun go off
plenty quick. Hit Pete in bread basket. Make plenty bad hole no cork up.</q></p>

<p>His weapon was still aimed directly at the discomfited riverman’s person, and
Schaeffer seemed for the moment bereft of ideas for a proper retort. The silence
was swiftly broken by a loud guffaw from one of the spectators, to whom the
whole affair seemed to appeal as something uncommonly amusing.</p>

<p><q>By thunder, boys!</q> he chuckled. <q>Hanged if the flea-bitten old cuss ain’t
right! The kid’s comin’ around fast. I move we call this the end o’ the first
round, an’ let the fight go on. It’ll help pass the time away, if nothin’
else.</q></p>

<p>Schaeffer snapped out an angry expostulation, but the Indian’s idea seemed to
take with the rough-and-ready crowd. Not one of them thought for an instant that
the contest could possibly be drawn out for more than a few minutes longer, or
they would, perhaps, not have been so eager. As it was, however, they took the
Indian’s part with a rough sort of jocularity which the irritated drive boss
knew better than to oppose.</p>

<p>And so when Bainbridge struggled back to consciousness&mdash;it had not been a
complete knock-out, and he had never, save for the briefest second, been
entirely senseless&mdash;he found this unexpected condition of affairs.</p>

<p>As his glance flashed past the Indian’s inquiring black eyes, and came to
rest on Schaeffer’s sullen, hate-filled face, he made a queer, inarticulate
noise in his throat, and tried to scramble up. Moose placed a firm, restraining
hand quietly on his chest, and forced him back.</p>

<p><q>Take easy,</q> he whispered. <q>Plenty time. Big Punch lie still. Get wind.</q></p>

<p>Bob was no more anxious for this delay than was his complaining antagonist,
but he was forced by Moose to keep his place even to a point when the spectators
began to grumble. When at last he was allowed to get on his feet, however, he
was more than thankful for the redskin’s wisdom. Even now his legs were not
quite steady; the dragging lassitude and weakness which had gripped him were not
wholly gone.</p>

<p>It vanished an instant later before that rush of vim and vigor and fierce
determination&mdash;strange as the second wind which surprises the distressed
runner&mdash;that suddenly came over him.</p>

<p>He waited Schaeffer’s savage charge instead of meeting it; waited with a
cunning pretense of weakly swaying on his heels. But when the riverman was
almost on him, he side-stepped neatly, lashing out a stinging right which caught
his antagonist on one cheek, and sent him spinning around.</p>

<p>That blow was the beginning of the end. In itself it was nothing, but it
marked a vital change in Bainbridge’s method of fighting. Hitherto his work had
been clever boxing, to be sure, but just a trifle lacking in that dynamic energy
which animated his opponent. The sense of fight convention was so strongly
ingrained that, without consciousness of so doing, he was playing according to
the rules.</p>

<p>Now, though he lost not a particle of his former skill, he used the defensive
part of it less. He did not parry or block or feint so much. His work became
more simple, more elemental, and&mdash;more deadly. He was out for results now. The
hot blood tingled through his veins and flamed into his brain. The crude brute
lust for combat gripped him to the exclusion of all else. This man had hurt him
cruelly, and humiliated him beyond words. He meant to make him pay, and pay
well, for both these injuries. The only difference now between himself and his
opponent was that he continued to fight fairly, if ferociously, while Schaeffer
did not.</p>

<p>The latter found little opportunity of fouling, however. To his amazement, he
discovered that he needed every bit of skill and strength he possessed to keep
his feet. Bob bored into him relentlessly, slugging like a pile driver,
hammering at his stomach, raining well-directed blows on the heart and kidneys,
or varying them now and then with a solid jolt to the jaw.</p>

<p>At first Schaeffer met this extraordinary assault with blind confidence in
his ability to wear it out, accompanied by a furious anger at the presumption of
the man. But swiftly this mental attitude changed to doubt, nervousness&mdash;at
length to fear.</p>

<p>It was all so pitilessly indomitable, so machinelike, yet not at all
mechanical, that Schaeffer began to grow afraid. He had a yellow streak, of
course&mdash;men of his stamp usually have&mdash;and now it began to come out. His defense
grew weaker and more flurried. Bainbridge’s punches struck home with increasing
strength and frequency. Once, after a series of swift, smashing blows in the
face, Schaeffer staggered back and dropped his guard involuntarily. Bob was
following up with a straight body punch, but his cracked and bleeding fist
stopped less than an inch, it seemed, from his opponent’s heaving chest.</p>

<p><q>Put up your hands, you cur!</q> he panted harshly. <q>This fight isn’t over yet.
Put ’em up and get busy!</q></p>

<p>A second later, having obeyed ineffectually, Schaeffer was flung back into
the astonished crowd by a jolt which nearly cracked his jaw.</p>

<p><q>Let up on him!</q> suddenly cried one of the men who had been particularly
eager, earlier in the game, in urging Schaeffer to the attack. <q>He’s had enough,
I says. Time to quit an’ have done with it.</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge flung back a long lock of black hair with a quick jerk of his
head, and glared around the circle with fiercely blazing eyes.</p>

<p><q>Is that so?</q> he jeered. <q>Who’s running this game? I didn’t hear any talk
like that when I was getting the worst of it. You were ready enough to let him
do what he liked with me, so keep out of this now while he takes his
medicine.</q></p>

<p>His glance veered swiftly to Schaeffer’s face, looking like a chalky mask
dabbled with crimson, and he thrust his head forward.</p>

<p><q>Well?</q> he sneered. <q>Scared, are you? I thought you were yellow down at the
bottom. Put up your hands!</q> His voice was hard and cold, and utterly pitiless.
<q>I’m not half done with you yet.</q></p>

<p>The man’s exhausted, almost pitiful condition did not move him in the
slightest. He thought only of the fellow’s treachery, of the repeated
exhibitions of foul play and attempts to maim, and he had no mercy. When the
riverman raised his hands in a weak, instinctive attempt at defense, Bainbridge
leaped forward and broke his guard by smashing blows on the face.</p>

<p>Schaeffer gasped, cried out in agony and then thrust forward blind, groping
hands. He was a picture of utter helplessness, and suddenly the sight of him
standing there, with quivering lips and trembling hands, aroused in Bainbridge a
bitter disgust&mdash;disgust for Schaeffer, for himself, and every one in sight.</p>

<p>He stepped back, his heavy black brows contracted in a frown, and stood for a
second sizing up his man, and deciding just what sort of a punch would most
quickly end the contest. Like a flash he leaped forward. The blow started almost
at Bob’s hip, and held the whole compact mass of him behind it. It doubled
Schaeffer like a jackknife, and sent him whirling backward into the arms of his
men, a limp, utterly senseless mass.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER VII. MASTER OF THE SITUATION</h2>

<p>Consciously Bob Bainbridge stepped back a pace or two, and rested one hand on
the shoulder of Moose. He was breathing hard, and the reaction from the stress
and strain of vigorous fighting made him feel limp and unsteady.</p>

<p>No hint of this appeared on the surface. With cold, unemotional eyes he
watched three or four men pick up the unconscious Schaeffer and carry him back
to the tent.</p>

<p>Some of the men stood staring curiously, but the majority had gathered about
a brawny youngster, handsome in a physical way, with bold blue eyes, a thatch of
tawny yellow curls, and a reckless, dare-devil manner. He was one of those who
had been readiest to take Schaeffer’s part, and now, as he turned toward
Bainbridge, followed by a dozen or more of his companions, Bob was conscious of
a sudden, curious sense of familiarity with the boy’s face. For a second he
thought it simply the result of a rather good memory. This was his first sight
of Schaeffer’s river gang but it was quite possible he had run across the rather
striking youngster at some other time or place.</p>

<p>Curiously, yet&mdash;impassively, he watched the latter approach. There was a
devil-may-care impudence in the very swing of his lithe, muscular body. When he
came to a stop before the lumberman, hat stuck rakishly on one side of that
yellow thatch, and hands resting lightly on his slim hips, his whole manner was
one of such cool arrogance that Bob’s eyes narrowed, and the angry blood began
to tingle again through his veins.</p>

<p><q>Look here,</q> said the fellow insolently, <q>that was one dirty trick you played
on Pete, and you’re goin’ to pay for it. Do you know what we’re goin’ to
do?</q></p>

<p><q>Yes!</q> flamed Bainbridge, in a voice which made more than one husky river hog
start nervously. <q>I do! You’re going down to that jam on the jump&mdash;and
<em>work</em>! Get me? I mean real work, too, and not an imitation of kids
playing. Thanks to a crooked drive boss the logs are hung up where no drive ever
hung before. If you’d been half-way men you’d never have let such a thing
happen.</q></p>

<p><q>By cripes!</q> roared the blond furiously, leaping at Bob, <q>there ain’t a man
livin’ as can talk like that to me an’ git away with it. Why, you city dude, I’m
going to show you that you can’t&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>Cut that!</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge suddenly loosened his grip on the Indian’s shoulder, and thrust
his face squarely into the young fellow’s, until scarcely six inches separated
them. He said not another word, but something blazed in his black eyes which
presently sent the lids fluttering down over the blue ones, and brought a touch
of dull scarlet flaming dully beneath the deeply tanned skin. It was simply the
force of a stronger nature, a nature untroubled by brag and bluster which
imposes its will on others by sheer strength of character.</p>

<p>The instant the silent duel had ended, Bob flung back his head and glanced
again at the puzzled, waiting throng of men.</p>

<p><q>I’m Bob Bainbridge,</q> he said, in a crisp, unemotional tone, which was in odd
contrast to the sense of tension just passed. <q>We’ve wasted entirely too much
time jawing, and it’s up to you boys to get a move on. That jam’s got to be
started before sundown. Understand? Now, where’s the jam boss, Jack Peters?</q></p>

<p><q>Laid up,</q> explained one of the men, after a moment’s hesitation. <q>He got his
foot near cut off with an ax.</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge’s eves narrowed. This would be termed an accident, of course, but
there was no doubt in his mind that it was simply another score to the credit of
Schaeffer and the men who had bribed him to do his dirty work.</p>

<p><q>Humph!</q> he shrugged. <q>Where’s your dynamite, then? Oh, you’re the one, are
you? Well, get your stuff down to the jam in a hurry. How many charges have been
fired already?</q></p>

<p>With downcast eyes the riverman explained that dynamite had not yet been
used. Bob’s lips curled.</p>

<p><q>I might have guessed it,</q> he said scornfully. <q>Well, hustle along the canned
thunder! The rest of you get ready to follow down the drive.</q></p>

<p>The men obeyed without question, and in a moment were streaming toward the
jam. Besides command in Bainbridge’s voice, there was optimistic confidence
which stirred these rough-and-ready river hogs. Because Schaeffer ordered it
they had dawdled along fruitlessly for several days, knowing perfectly well that
the jam was beyond any hope from picking, and that dynamite was the only thing
which would stir it. Superficially they had enjoyed these days of loafing, but
deep down in their hearts had lingered a feeling of personal shame that a gang
of supposedly A-1 lumberjacks should be knowingly throwing away their time in
this manner.</p>

<p>The youngster with the bold blue eyes and curly yellow hair went with the
rest, but more slowly, perhaps, and biting his lip as he strode away. His face
was flushed darkly ad his muscular hands tightly clenched at the thought of
having allowed himself to be called down in this humiliating manner, without
even a word of retort. Even now he did not know why he had done it. The fact
that the newcomer was Bob Bainbridge was not a thing entirely to influence his
independent soul. There was something else&mdash;some quality in the man himself that
had made him knuckle down as he had never done before.</p>

<p>Puzzled, chagrined, scowling blackly, he slouched after his comrades, hands
thrust deep in trousers pockets, and feet kicking at roots or hummocks&mdash;for all
the world like a spoiled, sullen schoolboy.</p>

<p>Bainbridge was, by this time, utterly oblivious to the man’s very existence.
He had thrust from his mind every thought save the immediate pressing need of
starting the jam, and to this end he bent every effort.</p>

<p>While Jerry Calker was making ready the dynamite cartridges, Bob went out on
the great mass of logs piled up like a heap of gigantic jackstraws, and
inspected it hastily but thoroughly. It was he who directed the placing of the
first blast, and he who was the first to seek cover. He it was who first rushed
to the spot in the very midst of that shower of bark and splinters and wood
chips raining down after the upheaval of timber had subsided.</p>

<p>He saw the whole vast surface of the jam quiver and heave, and for a moment
he hoped the shot had been successful. That hope proved groundless, however. The
jam settled back into immovability again; they would have to try once more.</p>

<p>The second blast seemed at first to be no more effective than the other. Then
Bob’s keen eye perceived an encouraging variation. Over the surface of the jam a
curious, uneasy motion began to spread from one log to another. The crew, which
had run lightly out to the very face, worked swiftly with their peavies,
pulling, shoving, jerking the timbers this way and that. From his point of
vantage Bainbridge watched their work with approval. They were evidently far
from being the incompetents that first sight of them might have led one to
suppose. He noticed that the fellow with the curly yellow hair was particularly
skillful, having apparently laid aside his grouch, and taken hold from sheer
love of the work and delight in accomplishing something.</p>

<p>Somehow Bob could not help following his movements for a minute or two, and
presently, in spite of all that had gone before, his heart began to warm to the
lithe, active, fearless youngster who seemed to have the knack of always being
in the right place and doing the thing most needed at precisely the right
moment.</p>

<p><q>A good man,</q> Bainbridge muttered to himself at length, <q>Hanged if he
isn’t!</q></p>

<p>But now the jam was actually in motion, crawling forward with many creaks and
crackings. The men worked harder, accelerating its progress, and making sure
that nothing went wrong. Suddenly the whole central part of the face fell
forward into the stream with a tremendous crash, and there was a whirling,
backward rush on the part of those who had been working on the very brink. As
they zigzagged to shore by devious routes, they raised the gladsome cry:</p>

<p><q>She pulls, boys&mdash;she pulls!</q></p>

<p>The sound was as music to Bainbridge’s ears, but he only smiled grimly and
strode rapidly along the bank of the stream. His eyes were fixed on the foam and
spray and rolling, rushing timbers, on some of which, holding by their sharp
spikes and balancing perfectly, rode the skilled rivermen who preferred this
method to the more prosaic one of walking ashore.</p>

<p>One of these was the blond youngster, and presently, reaching a point on the
bend where he thought a man was needed to prevent fresh jamming, Bob beckoned
him ashore.</p>

<p>He came&mdash;lightly from log to log, or temporarily rode nearer the bank by
means of his peavey. His last easy spring brought him to land beside Bainbridge,
where he stood at silent attention, his boldly handsome face beginning to show
anew the look of sullen embarrassment it had momentarily lost.</p>

<p><q>Keep a lookout here for while,</q> Bob said briefly. <q>It’s rather a bad place.
By the way,</q> he went on, struck afresh by that haunting sense of familiarity
which had come to him before, <q>what’s your name?</q></p>

<p>The young giant dropped his lids, and his muscular fingers interlocked
tightly around the stout ash pole of the peavey.</p>

<p><q>Curly,</q> he said, in an oddly embarrassed tone.</p>

<p><q>Ah! That all?</q></p>

<p>The youngster hesitated, and then, flinging back his head, stared defiantly
at Bainbridge.</p>

<p><q>No,</q> he retorted. <q>It’s Kollock&mdash;Curly Kollock.</q></p>

<p>Bob frowned slightly. <q>Indeed! Any relation to Bill?</q></p>

<p><q>His brother.</q></p>

<p>The frown deepened and there was silence for a moment. Bill Kollock, the
<q>trouble man</q> of Elihu Crane and his associates in the Lumber Trust, was not a
character to commend himself to Bainbridge. The brother was more than likely to
be of the same breed, he reflected as he stared with hard, narrowing eyes at the
flushed, defiant face of the boy before him. And yet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><q>Well?</q> snapped the boy suddenly. <q>I s’pose this means git my time?</q></p>

<p>Bob raised his eyebrows. <q>Why so?</q> he inquired coldly.</p>

<p>Kollock shrugged his shoulders with an exaggerated nonchalance and ease which
defeated its purpose.</p>

<p><q>I don’t reckon you’re very keen about having a Kollock on your drive,</q> he
retorted.</p>

<p><q>That’s where you guess wrong,</q> returned Bainbridge, with a sudden bland
indifference. <q>If you want to quit, of course, that’s your own affair; but as
for laying you off, I never fire a good workman because his family doesn’t
happen to be to my liking. So far as anything really underhand is concerned</q>&mdash;he
paused for a second and looked the boy square in the eyes&mdash;<q>I’m not afraid of
that&mdash;from you.</q></p>

<p>Without waiting for a reply, he turned and strode on along the river bank,
leaving young Curly to stare after him, his face flushed, and a curious,
unwonted expression in his blue eyes.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII. THE EMPTY BOX</h2>

<p>As soon as the drive was actually started on its way downstream, Bob made
haste to bring some sort of order out of the chaos he had found. Having watched
the men at work, he was able to get some slight idea of their capabilities,
which was vitally necessary in dividing them into the <q>rear</q> and the <q>jam</q>
crew.</p>

<p>The latter, in charge of a hastily appointed foreman, went forward to take
charge of the head of the drive. The work of the rear comprised setting stranded
logs afloat, breaking up incipient jams, and other duties too numerous to
mention.</p>

<p>The men composing the squad were always the most skillful and experienced in
the gang. They had to be continually on the alert, working usually at high
tension, and more than half the time in icy water to their waists. They had to
be able to ride anything in the shape of a log in any sort of water, and work
day after day for twelve and fourteen hours at a stretch. They must be swift as
lightning in their movements, and possessed of judgment, ability, and nerve.</p>

<p>It was impossible, of course, for Bob to pick out an ideal rear crew from
merely having seen the men in action for a scant few minutes. He did not try.
He simply used his very excellent judgment, reserving mentally the right to
change his mind whenever he felt like it, and juggle the men around as he
chose.</p>

<p>The principal necessity was to start things moving. When he had done so,
Bainbridge returned to camp with the twofold object of giving the cook his
orders, and having a final settlement with Schaeffer. The latter was not
particularly pleasant, but it was important. The man must quit the crew at once.
Bob had made up his mind not to let the fellow spend even the night where he
would have a chance to talk with and perhaps influence the others. With this
determination uppermost, he passed by the mess tent to the other where the men
slept, pulled aside the flap, and stepped inside.</p>

<p>The place was a mess of blankets and half-dried clothes, but to Bob’s
surprise it was vacant of anything in the nature of a man. Evidently Schaeffer
had recovered and vamoosed. Thoughtfully he sought the cook, and put the
question.</p>

<p><q>Came in here an’ got some grub a full hour ago,</q> that servitor explained
briefly. <q>When he’d eat it he went off agin.</q></p>

<p><q>Didn’t he say where he was going?</q> Bainbridge asked.</p>

<p>The cook shook his head. <q>Nary word.</q></p>

<p><q>And you didn’t happen to see what direction he took?</q></p>

<p><q>Nary a sight,</q> was the reply. <q>I was busy inside.</q></p>

<p>Bob frowned for a second, and then shrugged his shoulders. After all, what
did it matter where the fellow had gone, so long as he had taken himself away?
It was very natural for him to avoid the man who had so humiliated him, though
it was rather puzzling to have him slip away without apparently encountering
any one.</p>

<p>Bob proceeded to give his orders to the cook, explaining that he would have
to pull up stakes at once and start down the river.</p>

<p><q>The boys will be a long way from here by nightfall,</q> he said, <q>so you’ll
have to hustle. I’ve saved out a couple of men to help you and the cookee,
who’ll be under your orders till you pitch camp to-night.</q></p>

<p>Outside the mess tent he hesitated an instant. Then he entered the other
tent. This time he did not pause by the door, but crossed hastily to the farther
corner, where there was a small space crudely partitioned off from the main
portion. This would be Schaeffer’s sanctum, of course, and Bob entered it
curiously&mdash;only to stop with an exclamation of mingled surprise, anger, and
chagrin.</p>

<p>The place was in the utmost disorder. Blankets were rolled up in a ball
and flung into the corner. Articles of wearing apparel were scattered about,
while over everything were sifted scraps of white paper in seemingly endless
quantity. It was these torn scraps that roused Bob’s indignation. He seemed to
know intuitively, without the evidence of the limp, empty book covers here and
there, that the foreman had taken time to tear into shreds every record and
paper connected with the drive which he possessed. Time books, scalers’
measurements&mdash;everything&mdash;had been destroyed practically beyond the possibility
of reconstruction. There would be no accurate way now by which the firm could
figure their profits or costs or labor charges. The very paying of the drive
crew would be a matter of guesswork.</p>

<p><q>Jove!</q> exclaimed Bainbridge through his clenched teeth. <q>I didn’t know a man
could be so rotten!</q></p>

<p>He stared at the wreck for a minute longer, and then turned over with his
foot the square, wooden box which lay upset in the middle of the mess.
Apparently it had served Schaeffer as a receptacle for these same records. It
was quite empty, but underneath lay something which brought a thoughtful,
questioning expression into the searcher’s face, and made him stoop to pick it
up.</p>

<p><q>Thirty-eight caliber,</q> he murmured, staring at the freshly opened pasteboard
box which had contained fifty cartridges. <q>Hum!</q></p>

<p>Presently he let it drop again. He did not move for a space, but stood
staring at the ground with that same odd, thoughtful pucker in his forehead.</p>

<p>There was nothing surprising in the fact of Schaeffer’s being armed, Neither
was it strange for a man in the riverman’s position to carry off his ammunition
loose instead of in the box. That was not the point. It was simply the train of
thought aroused which struck Bainbridge unpleasantly. He felt Schaeffer to be
capable of almost any villainy provided it could be accomplished with safety to
himself. The humiliation of that fight, too, had added a powerful incentive to
the one already offered by Crane and the Lumber Trust for the eclipse of Bob
Bainbridge. And a total eclipse would be so easy! Just a single shot fired from
the bushes at a moment when there was no one else about to see or hear. In this
wild country the chances of escaping were infinite. The man might not even be
suspected.</p>

<p>Bob suddenly moved his shoulders impatiently, frowned, and turned away. A
moment later his eyes twinkled mirthfully.</p>

<p><q>Another minute and I’d have the undertaker picked out,</q> he chuckled. <q>The
scoundrel hasn’t the common courage to do murder. All the same,</q> he added, with
a decisive squaring of the shoulders, <q>I’ll put a crimp in his little game about
those records. I’ll have cookee scrape ’em all up, and ship the whole bunch down
to John. That clerk, Wiggins, can put ’em together, I’ll bet! Patience is his
middle name&mdash;patience and picture puzzles. We’ll have the laugh on Pete, after
all&mdash;hanged if we won’t!</q></p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER IX. IN THE SWIFT CURRENT</h2>

<p>The clumsy, slow-moving scow loaded with the cook’s outfit and a supply of
bedding followed the drive downstream, and, that night, fastened up to the bank
close to the inlet of Deer Pond, the middle one of three small bodies of water
strung along the length of the Megantic. It was a full day’s work, much better
than Bainbridge had hoped for, and, as he approached the big drying fire flaming
up at one side of the camp made by Charlie Hanley, the cook, Bob shook his own
hand in silent, grinning self-congratulation. He knew that they were far from
being out of the woods yet, but a good beginning always means a lot, and he had
no word to say against this start-off.</p>

<p>Presently the various driving crews appeared, wet to the skin from the waist
down, and ravenously hungry. The drying racks were swiftly steaming with the
soggy garments, and the men fell to upon their supper without a second’s delay.
There was little conversation&mdash;they were too busy for that; but Bainbridge
noticed with satisfaction that a certain element of good-tempered raillery
seemed to prevail. Evidently the crowd as a whole bore no grudge against the man
who had given them such a tongue-lashing that morning. In fact, if one could
judge from their manner toward their boss, they thought a lot more of him for
having done so.</p>

<p>Next day all hands did even better, and nightfall found them at the inlet of
Loon Lake, with the drive before them. Bob could not understand it. All day he
had been expecting some disagreeable happening of a nature to retard their
progress which could be laid at the door of the trust. When it did not come he
was almost disappointed. It was impossible to believe that Crane had given up so
easily; he was not that sort. He would explode a bombshell of some sort soon,
and the longer he delayed the more deadly was likely to be the nature of his
attack.</p>

<p>However, there was nothing to be gained in discounting the future, nor time
to spare for fretting over the unknown. Bob was far too busy during the daylight
hours even to think of Crane or his satellites. It was a ticklish job to get the
drive across even so small a body of water as the so-called lake, and it took
one entire day and the better part of another. It was done without mishap,
however, and Bainbridge was just congratulating himself on having got safely
over one of the most disagreeable bits of the entire distance when Jerry Calker
approached him as he stood watching the last few logs bob slowly out of the lake
into the swifter current of the stream.</p>

<p><q>Jack wants to know can you spare him a few minutes, sir,</q> he explained.
<q>There’s a bit of trouble down below.</q></p>

<p><q>What kind of trouble?</q> Bob asked swiftly, turning downstream without an
instant’s delay; and walking by the side of the dynamite man.</p>

<p>Calker scratched his head slowly. <q>I ain’t quite certain sure, Mr.
Bainbridge,</q> he drawled, <q>but I got a idea there’s a fellow with a mill who’s
run out a sortin’ boom that’s goin’ to hang up our drive if we ain’t mighty
keerful.</q></p>

<p><q>A mill!</q> exclaimed Bob incredulously. <q>Why, there isn’t such a thing within
twenty miles&mdash;at least, there wasn’t three months ago.</q></p>

<p>Calker grinned. <q>Thought it looked kinda new. I couldn’t rightly say that
it’s finished, but there ain’t no manner of a doubt about the boom. The jam had
started before I come away, an’ I left Jack havin’ it hot an’ heavy with a
red-headed son of a gun who sure looked as if scrap was his middle name.</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge frowned, but asked no further questions. He scarcely spoke, in
fact, during all of the four miles, but it was evident to his observing
companion that he was doing a lot of thinking.</p>

<p>Long before reaching the point of obstruction it became evident that another
jam had formed. The current grew more and more sluggish, and the progress of the
logs downstream became slower and slower, until at length the entire surface of
the water was covered with floating timber. These in turn crowded upon one
another with a rapidity which threatened to equal that first jam unless
something was swiftly done.</p>

<p>Hurrying on, Bob presently caught up with a throng of his own men, who had
apparently just landed from the dangerous, constantly shifting surface of the
river. They looked at him with a frank curiosity, as if wondering what he meant
to do in this emergency. On the faces of a few were expressions of grim,
anticipatory amusement, but Bainbridge heeded these no more than he had the
others. Without pausing even glancing to right or left, he strode on, and
reached the scene of action.</p>

<p>On the same bank, a little way back from the water, stood a small building,
so hastily thrown together that the roof was not yet completed. One or two men
were standing near it, staring interestedly at the crowd gathered about
something at the water’s edge which Bob at once saw to be one end of a massive,
well-constructed log boom. The other end, out beyond the middle of the river,
was supported by some stout spiles, and the whole affair took up so much of the
stream’s width that Bainbridge’s drive had jammed against it hard and fast.</p>

<p>All this Bob took in without slackening his pace. Reaching the outer edge of
the circle, he pushed through to where Jack Peters, his jam boss, stood facing a
compact group of six or eight strangers, gathered closely about the end of the
boom, Jack was florid with rage, and choking with impotent fury. The strangers
composing the little group instantly struck Bob as being singularly strong and
rugged. They looked as if they had been picked for their physical efficiency.
Each one was armed with rifle or pistol, while their leader, a competent-looking
person with red hair and whiskers, held in one hand a snub-nosed, businesslike
automatic.</p>

<p><q>Well, Jack,</q> Bainbridge said curtly, as he reached the foreman’s side,
<q>what’s the trouble?</q></p>

<p>Before Peters could reply the red-haired man took a single step forward and
faced Bob.</p>

<p><q>I can tell you in two shakes of a lamb’s tail,</q> he snapped viciously. <q>This
river hog o’ yours thinks he kin play the devil with my boom, but he’s got
another guess comin’. I own this land an’ that sawmill. I got a right to run my
booms out in the river same as anybody else. I ain’t lookin’ for trouble, but
the first man as tries any monkey business wants to look out, that’s all.</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge raised his eyebrows, and let his gaze wander leisurely from the
man’s head to his heels with an expression which brought an added touch of color
to the already flushed cheeks.</p>

<p><q>Indeed!</q> he drawled. <q>Who are you?</q></p>

<p><q>Who be I?</q> retorted the other angrily. <q>Humph! I don’t see that it makes no
difference, but my name’s Joyce&mdash;John Joyce. An’ I ain’t the kind as backs down
an’ takes water, believe me!</q></p>

<p>A singularly irritating smile curved the corners of Bob’s lips. His unruffled
composure served, as he hoped it might, to increase the rage of Mr. Joyce.</p>

<p><q>Do you realize that you’re obstructing navigation?</q> he inquired suavely.</p>

<p><q>I don’t admit it,</q> snapped Joyce. <q>There’s plenty of room for your drive to
git past if you had a gang that knew their business, instead of a lot o’
greenhorns.</q></p>

<p><q>I dare say you could give us all points,</q> Bainbridge murmured smoothly, with
just the right inflection of sarcasm to sting. It had suddenly occurred to him
that the fellow’s object was to make him lose his temper, and thus precipitate a
clash, during which almost anything might be accomplished. Not only did he
refuse to let go his grip, but he did his very best to goad Joyce himself into
flaming out, and possibly betraying a few secrets.</p>

<p><q>That’s hardly the question, though,</q> he went on swiftly. <q>Strikes me you’ve
been rather premature in running out the boom. Your mill isn’t operating, and I
have yet to see a single log coming downstream except our own.</q></p>

<p><q>Never you mind that,</q> retorted Joyce hotly. <q>Do you think a man’s going to
wait till his timber comes in sight afore makin’ arrangements to take care of
it? You can’t come over me with no soft talk like that. The boom’s there, an’
there it stays. Half the river’s clear for you to use, an’ that’s all you
gets.</q></p>

<p><q>Hum! That’s your last word, is it?</q> inquired Bainbridge quietly. <q>You even
refuse to let us swing the boom around so we can break our jam?</q></p>

<p><q>I do!</q> replied the red-haired individual emphatically. <q>The first man that
tries to monkey with my property will wish he hadn’t, that’s all I got to
say.</q></p>

<p>He raised his automatic significantly, but Bob was not even looking at him.
The young man’s gaze had swept out to the face of the jam, and in an incredibly
short space an accurate picture of its appearance had been photographed on his
brain. Still without giving Joyce the satisfaction of a glance, he turned away,
motioning Peters to accompany him.</p>

<p><q>A put-up job, of course,</q> he said tersely, when they were through the circle
of his own men. <q>Same gang who bought Schaeffer.</q></p>

<p>The jam boss nodded in a troubled way. <q>I’m afraid they’ve got us bad, too.
It’s goin’ to take one long time pickin’ that jam apart, but I can’t see
anythin’ else to do. I spose I’d better start ’em at it right away, sir.</q></p>

<p><q>Not at all,</q> retorted Bob swiftly. <q>Do nothing of the kind. Let ’em stay
just where they are, Jerry!</q></p>

<p>At the sound of his imperative undertone Calker hustled up. There was a brief
interchange of words between the trio, during which the faces of both
lumberjacks brightened&mdash;amazingly. Then all three disappeared into the bushes a
little way upstream, from which they did not emerge for a considerable time.</p>

<p>When they finally appeared, Bainbridge held by his side a shapeless package
of considerable size. Had not Peters and Calker walked so close beside him as he
bent his way leisurely toward the crowd about the jam, it would probably have
been noticed that this package was made up of a dozen or more sticks of giant
powder fastened securely together, and depending from a sling of stout manila
rope.</p>

<p>The line of rivermen had turned, and were watching his approach with
interested curiosity, but Joyce and his gang could see nothing. Reaching the
men, Bob paused, struck a match, and carefully lighted the end of a protruding
fuse. As it sputtered up he gave a short, sharp word of command, the line of men
opened instantly to let him through, and a second later he stood not a dozen
paces from Joyce, deliberately swinging the deadly package round and round his
head.</p>

<p>For a second there was a breathless hush. Then the red-haired man leaped
forward.</p>

<p><q>Stop!</q> he roared. <q>You young whelp, if you&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p>He broke off with a gurgling sound, and the color left his face. With a final
swing, Bob loosened his hold on the bundle, which curved in a perfect arc over
the rear of the jam, over the jagged crest, and dropped swiftly out of sight
amid the massive timbers upended in confusion along the face and close to the
spot where protruded the freshly driven spiles which had caused all the
trouble.</p>

<p>An instant later the whole throng of men hustled frantically for cover.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER X. THE POWER BEHIND IT ALL</h2>

<p>In less than sixty seconds&mdash;so close had been Bob’s calculations&mdash;came a
detonation which shook the earth, making several of the running men stagger and
lose their stride. Up spurted a great mass of water, carrying with it massive
logs leaping like agonized things alive. They fell back again, followed by a
shower of débris mingled with fine spray, which the wind sifted down on the
heads of the ducking, dodging men.</p>

<p>From his place behind a stump Bainbridge rose swiftly, shielding his face
with one crooked arm from the rain of chips and splinters and bits of bark, and
stared eagerly toward the jam. It took but a moment to see that the spiles had
disappeared, and the boom was shattered. Moreover, the key logs of the jam were
so loosened that the whole drive was again on its way downstream. Bob turned to
Peters with a gesture of satisfaction.</p>

<p><q>She’s off, Jack,</q> he said. <q>Get a wiggle on, now, and rush her along. The
water’s dropping every minute, and we’ve got a mean stretch to cover before we
strike the Penobscot. I’ll go back and hustle the rear along&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p>He stopped abruptly, and whirled around as a voice, shrill and trembling with
passion, was raised behind him.</p>

<p><q>You’ll pay for that, you meddlin’ pup! I’ll teach you to go blowin’ up
folks’ property, an’ mighty near committin’ murder! I’ll show you you can’t play
tricks on John Joyce an’ get away with it. That game might work with some, but
it won’t&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p>Things happened so swiftly after that that even the men standing around were
quite unable to understand exactly what was doing, and which of the two was
really the one who started the trouble.</p>

<p>The instant Bob turned he saw that Joyce was either beside himself with rage,
or giving a most astonishingly good imitation of that condition. His face was
purple, with veins standing out on his forehead like cords. His eyes glared with
that combination of rage and hate which a badly frightened man almost invariably
feels for the cause of his mental disturbance. The automatic was leveled in his
hand, and one finger trembled on the trigger.</p>

<p>For a single instant Bainbridge stood rigid, every muscle suddenly tensing.
Perhaps he read a hint of Joyce’s purpose in the fellow’s eye; perhaps it was
simply intuition which made him guess what was coming. At all events, suddenly,
and without warning, he launched his lithe body through the air exactly as in
the manner of the old forbidden flying tackle.</p>

<p>His shoulder struck Joyce’s knees, and the wicked, snapping shot of the
revolver rang out at precisely the same moment. There was a yell of fury,
followed by a crash. Then almost oppressive silence.</p>

<p>Bob was on his feet like a cat, fingers gripping the automatic he had
snatched from the owner’s nerveless hand. His jaw was hard, and there was a
glint of more than anger in the eyes he bent upon Joyce’s supporters hurrying up
to the aid of their chief.</p>

<p><q>Hands up!</q> he cried out harshly, <q>Quick!</q></p>

<p>He did not have to speak twice. There was something in his voice, coupled
with an emphatic gesture with the automatic, which made those six men, big and
powerful as they were, obey him with remarkable unanimity.</p>

<p><q>Take their guns, Jack,</q> continued Bainbridge, in that same commanding
voice.</p>

<p>Peters stepped forward to obey. The first man drew back instinctively, and
started to pull down the hand which held a revolver. Without an instant’s
hesitation Bob fired. The bullet struck the upraised weapon on its blued-steel
barrel, wringing a cry of surprise and pain from the fellow’s lips as he dropped
the gun.</p>

<p>There was no more trouble after that, Peters collected four revolvers and two
Remingtons. Then he glanced questioningly at Bainbridge.</p>

<p><q>Throw ’em in the river,</q> the latter commander curtly. <q>’Way out in the
middle, where they can’t be recovered.</q></p>

<p>The riverman walked a few steps toward the bank; then, pausing, he glanced
back at the straight young figure standing behind him.</p>

<p><q>They’re mighty good guns,</q> he said hesitatingly. <q>Seems a shame to throw ’em
away like this.</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge returned briefly: <q>I’m simply pulling the stings of this
gang.</q></p>

<p>He watched his man fling the weapons, one after another, into the stream, and
then, sending the automatic splashing after the others, he turned suddenly back
to the six humiliated individuals before him.</p>

<p><q>Go!</q> he commanded, with a momentary flare of passion. <q>Beat it, and don’t
let me set eyes on you again&mdash;understand? I won’t be so easy on you the next
time. Here, take that scum with you. He’s only stunned.</q></p>

<p>He waited, staring from under lowered lids, until the gang had disappeared in
the bushes, half dragging, half carrying their stunned leader with them. Then,
with a long sigh, he turned slowly and smiled at Peters.</p>

<p><q>All right, Jack,</q> he said quietly. <q>I don’t think we’ll have any more
trouble here. Just hustle all you can to make up for this delay.</q></p>

<p>Peters grinned, and snapped out some orders to the men which sent them flying
along the bank and even out on the stream over the tumbling logs. But as they
went they cast glances of open, unadulterated admiration at the young man coolly
brushing a bit of mud from one shoulder, and their comments to each other left
no trace of doubt of their thorough approval of everything he had said and
done.</p>

<p>Bob heard some of them, and when the men had gone on he smiled a bit. To get
that drive down successfully he knew he must have the men with him. He knew also
that deliberate planning could not have accomplished that result half so well as
this encounter with the tools of the Lumber Trust. The whole affair had proved a
great piece of luck for him, thought the young lumberman. His meditation was
broken in upon by the sound of a strange voice.</p>

<p><q>I had no idea lumbering was such a strenuous occupation.</q></p>

<p>A moment later Bainbridge was looking into a pair of pleasant, friendly eyes
set in the handsome face of a man of about fifty. He was roughly dressed in
well-worn, but finely made fishing clothes, and carried a good trout rod in one
hand. There was, too, about the stranger an air of forceful capability which
attracted the younger man.</p>

<p><q>It’s not usually quite so full of incident,</q> said Bob; <q>but I don’t believe
you’d ever find it exactly tame.</q></p>

<p>The stranger smiled, and made a comprehensive gesture with his hands. <q>And
this is your idea of incident,</q> he murmured whimsically. <q>I should call it
something decidedly stronger.</q></p>

<p>He hesitated for an instant, then moved closer to Bob.</p>

<p><q>You’re going downstream, aren’t you? Do you mind if I walk along with you?
My camp’s down that way.</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge acquiesced readily. There was something very taking about the
stranger, and within ten minutes he found himself chatting as if to an old
friend. His companion turned out to be Wolcott Sears, of Boston, on a two weeks’
trip in the Maine woods. The name was only vaguely familiar, but Bob felt sure
from his manner that he was a man of affairs. He was tremendously interested in
hearing all about the peculiar conditions of this particular drive, and before
Bainbridge realized it he had given a brief narrative of his fight with the
Lumber Trust and the events which had grown out of it.</p>

<p><q>You interest me extraordinarily, Mr. Bainbridge,</q> the older man said, in his
crisp, decisive way, when at last they paused at the point several miles below
the scene of the last jam, where Sears had to branch off to reach his camp.
<q>Things of this sort always do, for it’s only those one has to struggle for
which are really worth while. You’ve certainly had to fight hard in this case,
but you’ve practically won out, haven’t you? After this last fracas I shouldn’t
suppose there’d be much chance for further interference.</q></p>

<p>Bob shrugged his shoulders and smiled a little. <q>You sadly underestimate the
power of the trust, Mr. Sears. I shan’t be beyond the chance of interference
until the drive is safe in our mill booms at Lancaster, and even then it
wouldn’t surprise me if they’d try to work some dirty trick.</q></p>

<p>Sears frowned indignantly; then his face brightened.</p>

<p><q>In spite of everything I think I should bet on you.</q> he chuckled. <q>There’s
a certain vigor in your method of dealing with these people which makes for
success. I really believe you’ll win, Mr. Bainbridge, and I surely hope so. It
has been a great pleasure to meet you, and I trust one to be repeated. I shall
be hereabouts for some time yet, and may run across you before I leave.</q></p>

<p>Bob warmly reciprocated his feeling, and, after a hearty handshake, turned
south along the river, while Sears disappeared in the undergrowth to the
westward.</p>

<p><q>Fine man,</q> commented the younger man aloud. <q>Hope I do run into him again.
Meanwhile, however, the rear isn’t coming along half quick enough, and I haven’t
seen a darn thing all afternoon of the wangan. I hope nothing’s happened to it
and the grub. That would be one awful blow!</q></p>

<p>It was one that was spared him. Within half an hour the clumsy scow hove in
sight. It tied up to the bank a little later, and before dark preparations for
supper were going on merrily.</p>

<p>Bob did not get in till later. Assured that all was well with the cook and
his staff, he went on downstream to see how Peters and his gang were
progressing. On his return he discovered a stranger warming himself by the
drying fire. He looked like an old-time woodsman, and the instant Bainbridge
appeared he was on his feet, extracting an envelope from the interior of his
hat.</p>

<p><q>From Mr. Tweedy, sir.</q></p>

<p>The young lumberman ripped it open without a premonition of the blow in store
for him. It was natural for Tweedy to write. He would be reporting his success
in the matter of credit, of course, and probably gloating over the amount of
manufactured lumber he had sold in so short a time. Bainbridge noted that it had
been written in the Bangor office the night before. Then, settling himself by
the fire, he proceeded to read:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style='text-indent:0'><span class='sc'>Dear Bobby:</span> It’s all up with us,
boy. We’re done, and we may as well admit it
first as last and make what terms we can with the gang. I can’t get credit
anywhere. Crane’s been ahead of me and spilled the beans each time. What’s more,
Gastich absolutely refuses to renew that note. Says he must have the cash for
some stocks he’s carrying, and all that; but you know what it means. It’s due in
less than a week, and I can’t for the life of me see an earthly way of scraping
the money together. Last of all&mdash;and worst of all&mdash;I haven’t been able to make a
single sale of lumber for the simple reason that the trust has cut prices below
cost and has taken every customer from us. If I cut to meet them they go lower.
You can see that. They’ve got the stock and the resources. Crane’s set out to
ruin us at any cost, and he’s succeeded. It hurts like sin to say it, boy, but
there’s nothing left to do but give in and make the best terms we can. Let me
hear from you at once. Yours ever, <span class='sc'>John Tweedy</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XI. NO QUITTER</h2>

<p>The letter dropped into Bob’s lap, and for a long minute he sat staring into
the yellow, dancing flames. His face was blank, and just a little white, for the
blow had been a heavy one, and totally unexpected. He could not seem to
understand it. It was unbelievable that he and Tweedy, who had been fair and
square in every one of their business dealings, could be forced to the wall by
such a monster of corruption as Elihu Crane.</p>

<p>There must be some mistake. Tweedy must have been thrown into one of his
unjustifiable panics. That was it, of course.</p>

<p>Bob picked up the letter to read it carefully again.</p>

<p>He perused it to the last word, and then leaned back against the sapling, his
face drawn and somber. It really did not sound like a mistake. It was all clear
and logical, and singularly cohesive. It was the sort of thing Crane would
delight in planning and putting into execution&mdash;the cutting of prices on a
competitor. Tweedy had written that if they attempted to cut under the trust’s
present rates, there would be a further reduction. That was quite true. Bob
knew, because he had had a vast deal of experience with the trust’s method of
doing business. They would ruin him, no matter how great the cost, because he
was dangerous to their continued well-being. With Bainbridge in the ring, and
fighting vigorously against the graft and wholesale theft of timberlands, those
juicy melon cuttings which had been so pleasing to the stockholders would
cease&mdash;therefore Bainbridge must go.</p>

<p>Presently Bob’s eyes fell again to the letter, and somehow that single
sentence seemed to stand out as if written in capitals: <q>It hurts like sin to
say it, boy, but there’s nothing left to do but give in and make the best terms
we can.</q></p>

<p>For a second Bob stared, the blood rushing into his face, a crimson flood.
Make terms with Crane? Go on his knees to that scoundrel, who had long ago
parted with the last shred of decency and self-respect? Not much!</p>

<p>They must have resources enough to meet that note, at least. The trust could
not keep the price of lumber down indefinitely. They must weather the storm in
some way. And when this drive was safe at the mills, ready to be cut into
lumber, they would have the laugh on Elihu Crane.</p>

<p>Oblivious to the men about him, even to the fact that the cook had some time
ago announced supper, Bainbridge began to search his mind for means of staving
off the evil day. Most of the stocks and bonds constituting his private fortune
had been already pledged as collateral for loans to the firm. He still had a few
thousand dollars’ worth of Steel Preferred which could be sold; and there was
Pinecrest, the beautiful and costly home on the outskirts of Bangor, which had
been left him by his father. It should not be difficult to raise a mortgage of
ten thousand, at least, on the place.</p>

<p><q>The note’s for ten thousand, so that’s all straightened out,</q> Bainbridge
murmured, with a snap of his fingers. <q>The money from the stock can go for
current expenses. I’ll fix it up this very night.</q></p>

<p>He did. Fortunately Tweedy held his power of attorney with the right to sign
checks and execute papers of any sort, so it was possible for him to put through
these deals without his returning to Bangor. That another note for nearly as
much as the first fell due in little more than a fortnight Bainbridge knew quite
well. By that time, however, he fully intended to have the drive down as far as
their mill at Lancaster, fifty miles or so above Bangor. And it is always
possible to raise money on timber, even in the rough.</p>

<p>Of course, if the trust continued their campaign of cutting prices Bob’s
plans would be materially affected. He could not believe, however, that they
would do such a thing for any great length of time. A dollar meant as much to
them as to any one, and even the pleasure of ruining a competitor would scarcely
compensate for the loss of so much money.</p>

<p>A long letter of instruction and explanation was written to Tweedy that
night, and despatched the first thing in the morning by the trusty hand of Joe
Moose, the Indian. That off his mind, Bob returned to his drive with renewed
vigor, for the necessity for haste was now even greater than before. It was a
question of getting the logs down in double-quick time or being dragged into the
bankruptcy court; and that sort of notoriety did not appeal in the least to the
young man.</p>

<p>It was this feeling of necessity which got Bob up next morning before the
blackness of the night was more than faintly tinged by streaks of pale gray in
the east. He wanted to be off and doing; even necessary inaction chafed. It
seemed an eternity before the men had finished breakfast, and were ready for the
day’s work. As a matter of fact, they took less time than usual, for something
of Bainbridge’s intense eagerness for speed seemed to have made itself felt.</p>

<p>All morning Bob worked like a Trojan getting the drive out into the Katahdin
River. He did not storm and swear at his men, as many bosses do. Instead he had
a way of jollying them along in a manner which might sound superficially like
fun, but which held more than an undercurrent of seriousness. He treated them as
human beings, not as if they were slaves from whom every last atom of work was
to be extracted. And yet, when the need arose, he could hand out a rebuke, the
caustic sting of which was enough to make a man’s hair stand on end. The result
was that the crew soon admired him, and when they found how urgent was the need
for haste they fell to with a will, and gave the best that was in them.</p>

<p>Bainbridge was not long in perceiving their attitude, and it gratified him
intensely. He had never actually had charge of a drive before. He knew the
theory, of course, but that is very different from the practical operation; and
the discovery that he could handle a rough-and-ready crowd like this in a manner
so totally different from that generally practiced by bosses of crews gave him
no small satisfaction.</p>

<p>By dint of constant labor, at which Bob spared neither himself nor his men,
the drive was successfully swung into the slightly larger river by two o’clock.
There was no real respite even then. The stream was almost as difficult as the
Megantic, and constant watchfulness was necessary to prevent fresh jams at a
number of points. Consequently the men snatched a hurried dinner in relays and
hustled back to work again.</p>

<p>It was about three, and Bob had just left the spot where only the most
strenuous personal labor on the part of himself and four river jacks had kept
the drive from jamming. He was hot and sweaty, and generally weary as he
continued his way downstream, and his wrath was naturally instant when, on
suddenly rounding a bend, he came upon Curly Kollock, cool, calm, and unruffled,
sitting comfortably on a rock, enjoying a cigarette.</p>

<p>As the latter saw Bainbridge, he flushed slightly, and half rose from the
bowlder. Then, with a stubborn twist of his lips, he sank back again, pulling
hard on the cigarette, and doing his best to look unconcerned.</p>

<p>Bob walked straight up to him, and stopped.</p>

<p><q>Well,</q> he said bitingly, <q>I’m sorry you’ve lost the use of your feet and
hands. Is it paralysis?</q></p>

<p>Kollock’s flush deepened, and he mumbled something inane about taking a
smoke. He found that he had arisen, apparently without volition, and was
standing before the other man, who stared at him a long half minute.</p>

<p><q>This is no rest cure,</q> said Bob at length. <q>You’re paid for helping the
drive along. I don’t want any loafers in this gang. Understand? Now, get down to
the head of the drive&mdash;and do something!</q></p>

<p>Kollock’s face was flaming, and his eyes gleamed angrily. <q>I don’t take that
line of talk from anybody!</q> he growled, clenching his fists threateningly.
<q>I’ll&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>You’ll do what I said, and do it quick!</q> Bainbridge’s voice was not raised
above a conversational pitch, but there was a ring in it which seemed to take
the fight and bluster out of the big riverman with the effectiveness of a keen
knife thrust into an inflated bladder. For a second he stood in awkward silence,
swallowing hard in his embarrassment. Then he raised his head again.</p>

<p><q>I don’t need your job,</q> he said, in a poor imitation of devil-may-care
defiance. <q>I’ll get my time, and&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge cut him short. <q>You’ll get down to the drive and <em>work</em>.
Beat it now&mdash;quick!</q></p>

<p>Without another protesting word, Kollock turned meekly and obeyed.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XII. THE TEST</h2>

<p>Before he had taken a dozen steps, Kollock was furious with himself, and by
the time Bainbridge was out of sight the wrath of the riverman had risen to a
white heat.</p>

<p>From the first he had tried to dislike Bainbridge. Pete Schaeffer had been
his friend, and after he had been whipped Curly made up his mind that there
could be no getting along in a crew bossed by the victor. Then came that brief
but pointed interview with Bob which affected him so oddly. He had never before
had anybody tell him that he was to be trusted; most bosses had been emphatic in
saying the opposite thing. Or, if they kept silent, they showed in a dozen
obvious ways that they considered him in the same class with his notorious
brother.</p>

<p>Then there was the incident of the day before. Curly could not help admiring
the manner in which Bainbridge had handled the crowd that was trying to hold up
the drive. It was exactly the sort of thing he would like to have done himself,
and his heart warmed toward the man with the courage and ability to act in that
fashion. Moreover, Jack Joyce was an old enemy of his, and the sight of the
fellow’s humiliation had inclined the riverman even more strongly toward the man
who had brought it about.</p>

<p>But that was over now, he told himself furiously as he stamped along the
stream, hands clenched and face set in a black scowl. He hated Bainbridge! The
man had no right to jump on him that way. How did he know what had been the
cause of Kollock’s behavior? He had asked no questions, given Curly no chance to
explain even had the latter been inclined to lower himself to that extent. He
had taken it for granted that the river jack was loafing in spite of the fact
that record as a worker was equal to that of the best.</p>

<p>This was where the sting lay. Kollock was aggrieved and disgruntled because
of what was, to him, a very good reason. There had been a definite object in his
pause by that stone. The night before he had received a brief note from Bill, in
which he was urged to <q>make use of any chance you git to do&mdash;you know what.</q></p>

<p>Curly did know <q>what</q> very well. It meant that he was to thwart and delay the
progress of the drive by any means in his power. <em>Any</em> means! The
simplest, of course, was to cause some to happen to Bainbridge himself. Bill had
not hesitated to suggest several ways by which this happy end could be reached.
None of them appealed particularly to Curly. He was not overscrupulous, but he
disliked doing up a man in cold blood without giving him even a ghost of a show.
Still, Bill had done him good turns more than once when he was out of work; and,
last but not least, there was the financial side of the affair. Curly had never
been told who or what was back of these attacks on the independent lumber
company, but he knew there was plenty of money in it.</p>

<p>All this he had been thinking over as he sat smoking that cigarette. In the
end he decided to have nothing to do with it. Bainbridge had trusted him and
played square. For that reason he would be equally square and aboveboard, and
let this dirty work alone.</p>

<p>That was what he <em>had</em> decided, but now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He gritted his teeth, glared fiercely around, and came to an abrupt stop.
Every instinct of the riverman was aroused. On his left the river dropped over
short falls into a narrow gorge. It was a spot where things were likely to
happen at any time, and where a man or two should have been stationed
continually. Curly knew, in fact, that there had been men here all morning. They
had been called away for some purpose, leaving the little falls unguarded. And
as he stood there his practiced eyes told him that he was beholding the very
start of a jam.</p>

<p>A log, plunging over the falls, upended. Another was thrust under it. A third
and fourth, coming down together, caught on the obstruction, all being held by
some stones rising midstream. Before the current could tear them loose several
more timbers were forced against the mass which was piling up so swiftly,
bridging to the opposite shore.</p>

<p>To carry out that angry resolve of a minute or two ago, Curly should have
rolled himself another cigarette, and watched the growing damage with a sardonic
smile. He did nothing of the sort. For a flash he had forgotten his grievance,
and was a <q>river hog,</q> pure and simple. The stoppage must be broken before it
reached the proportions of a real jam. There was no one else to do it, and so he
leaped to the task without a second’s pause for thought.</p>

<p>Upstream he ran a few feet, his eyes fixed on the surface of the river above
the falls. Then he saw what he wanted. An instant later, using his peavey much
as a pole vaulter does his pole, he leaped straight out over the water, landed
squarely on a big log, and was carried down to the falls&mdash;and over them.</p>

<p>He took the drop easily, riding the log with that perfect balance which is
second nature to the seasoned riverman. When the timber bumped against the
rapidly forming jam, Curly leaped again, thrusting the log down as he did so,
and landed on the solid barrier. Scrambling lightly over to the face of this, he
thrust deftly with his peavey into the mass, and began to work desperately to
loosen the key log&mdash;that first upended stick of pine which had started the whole
trouble, and which must be started before the rest of the barrier would
give.</p>

<p>He got a good hold on it, but the thing defied his efforts to tear it loose.
It was wedged too tightly for even his great strength, and, though he seemed to
feel it move slightly, he strained his muscles to the utmost in vain to
accomplish anything further. Presently he realized, with a thrill, that the jam
was piling up behind him faster and faster. He ceased his efforts, and clamping
the peavey on timber above the key log, pried it free, and sent it bobbing
downstream. Another followed, and another still. Sweat poured in streams from
him, trickling blindingly into his eyes, but he did not stop to wipe it away.
There was no time. He must go on doing his best till help came, or else&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A faint jar shook the jam. A second later Curly felt a hand lightly touch his
shoulder. A familiar voice sounded in his ear:</p>

<p><q>Good work, son! Where’s that trouble maker? Oh, I see. Let me drop down to
that ledge, where I can get a good hold. That’s the idea. Now grip her above me.
Fine! Ready, now? Yank away!</q></p>

<p>It was Bainbridge&mdash;swift, agile, incredibly fresh considering what he had
accomplished that day. For a moment or two Curly did not realize that this was
the man he hated. He simply felt an overwhelming thankfulness that some one had
come at last, and obeyed orders mechanically and without question.</p>

<p>But as his peavey gripped the end of that troublesome log, there suddenly
flamed into Curly’s mind&mdash;temptation. Bainbridge stood below him, perched
perilously on the very face of the jam. A little thrust&mdash;the tiniest movement of
the riverman’s arm&mdash;would send him plunging into the stream, while another
movement would suffice to drop one of the looser logs upon him. There were no
witnesses; the whole affair would pass as an unfortunate accident. A chance like
this, so easy, so absolutely safe, would never come again.</p>

<p><q>Now!</q> broke in the crisp voice of the lumberman. <q>Hard over, boy. Toward
me&mdash;all you know how!</q></p>

<p>Curly’s muscles strained as he threw every ounce of strength into the pull.
The key log creaked and groaned as if agony but was thrust gradually forward.
Curly felt it moving faster and faster, and instinctively he prepared for that
backward leap which would carry him out of reach of the treacherous avalanche of
falling logs.</p>

<p>A second later his peavey was torn from his hands by the sudden collapse of
half the face of the jam. The logs at his side vanished in the unexpected rush,
but that on which he stood remained firm for a precious moment. Below him he saw
Bainbridge whirl like a cat and grasp for something solid. Instantly he bent
over, reaching out both callous, muscular hands, and as swiftly Bob gripped
them. There was a heave, an upward scramble, another crash as the remainder of
the jam disappeared into the foaming water. But the two men had leaped in time,
and a moment later they were standing together on the bank.</p>

<p><q>Thank you&mdash;Curly,</q> Bainbridge said in a level voice. <q>That was
touch-and-go for a minute.</q></p>

<p>That was all, but somehow Curly knew that what he had done was understood and
appreciated. In the stress of the peril which the two had shared shoulder to
shoulder like common brother river hogs, Kollock’s anger and hate had vanished
utterly. He no longer desired revenge. His attitude of a scant half hour before
seemed small and mean and petty. He had saved the life of the man his brother
wanted out of the way, and, given the opportunity, he would do it as promptly
again.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII. THE LIMIT</h2>

<p>Curly Kollock’s interest and liking for his boss grew stronger day after day.
There was something about Bob Bainbridge which stirred the finer qualities in
his nature, and brought twinges of shame to the young riverman whenever he
thought how near he had come to throwing his lot with his brother. If Bill ever
showed up he resolved to tell him just what he thought of him, too. But in the
meantime, not being much of a penman, he made no effort to answer the letter. It
was sufficient that he considered himself cut loose from the whole miserable
bunch. If they were expecting aid from him in their plotting they were doomed to
disappointment.</p>

<p>More and more often as they descended the Katahdin River, the boy was stirred
to anger at the constant succession of moves made by that gang of crooks against
the man who fought them practically alone and singlehanded.</p>

<p>Along the river were several dams placed for the purpose of regulating the
head of water and facilitating the process of driving. They belonged to the
trust, but their owners were bound at all times to allow a normal head of water
when it was called for. Instead of doing this now, they played all sorts of
tricks on Bainbridge. When he particularly needed plenty of water to float his
drive past a shallow or narrow spot, the gates were arbitrarily shut down, and
the drive hung up. Again, at one point where the middle part of the drive had
jammed and the crew were occupied in picking it instead of using dynamite, the
gates which Bob had personally closed were raised without warning, letting down
a flood of water which struck the jam with terrific force. It gave instantly,
carrying three men with it. Two managed to escape by a miracle, and were dragged
ashore with broken limbs; the other was crushed and drowned.</p>

<p>After that Bainbridge placed guards at the various dams with instructions to
shoot any one who attempted to interfere with them. This resulted in a terrific
outcry on the part of Crane’s underlings, an appeal to the law, injunctions, and
all that sort of thing. To which Bainbridge paid no attention whatever. He went
on his way calmly, knowing well that they could not stop him in this manner, and
willing to put up with the inconvenience that would follow when it was all over
and he had returned to civilization.</p>

<p>Mr. Wolcott Sears continued his fishing trip along the route the lumbermen
were following, and began frequently to appear in camp for an evening pipe with
Bainbridge. One evening they had a private conference, which lasted until the
small hours, and the Boston capitalist finally departed, leaving Bainbridge
apparently much gratified.</p>

<p>The crew was with Bob to a man. By this time they had gathered an inkling of
the plot against the firm, and of the stakes involved. Men had strayed into camp
telling of the extraordinary reductions made by the trust in the price of
manufactured lumber. Large sales had resulted to various parties, report said,
thus preventing Bainbridge &amp; Tweedy, as well as several other small
independents, from disposing of a single plank.</p>

<p>The lumberjacks were not slow in putting two and two together. They
remembered rumors current in the big woods for many months of the fight which
had started between the trust and this man who was their boss. It was a fight to
the finish, people said, in which one side or the other must go under, From all
appearances it looked to these earnest, simple-minded woodsmen as if Bainbridge
would be vanquished unless he could get that drive safely into the mill booms;
and to that end they strained every nerve. They toiled from dawn to dark,
staggering into camp each night so utterly weary that they sometimes fell asleep
with their supper half eaten before them; only to be up before daybreak to do it
all over again.</p>

<p>It was a period of stress and strain, but it ended at last when the drive was
ushered into the Penobscot, to be seized by the strong current and urged on
toward the mills at Lancaster, that goal which had seemed a little while ago so
unattainable, yet which was now so near.</p>

<p>That very afternoon was perpetrated the crowning outrage. Bainbridge was shot
at from the bushes&mdash;shot at deliberately with an intent to kill which was
defeated only by the miracle of chance which made him bend over to tighten a
shoe lace at the precise moment of firing.</p>

<p>Wild with fury, the men who were present dashed in pursuit of the would-be
assassins, but to no purpose. They were in the land of civilization now, where
there were motor cars. By the time the crowd of rivermen had surged up the bank
and plunged through the undergrowth, the rascally tools of the trust were well
away, leaving their pursuers to rage impotently that there was not a gun in the
party with which the tires could be punctured and the car stopped.</p>

<p>The most angry of them all was Curly Kollock. He had double cause for wrath,
having received that morning a letter from the very town of Lancaster toward
which they were striving so hard to push the drive. Brief it was, and to the
point. He had played the traitor, Bill wrote scathingly. There was only one way
by which he could rid himself of the stigma, and return to the good graces of
the gang. He must come at once to a certain house on the outskirts of the town,
prepared to place himself absolutely in his brother’s hands.</p>

<p>When the younger Kollock read those lines he swore roundly. That even Bill
should dare write in such a manner made him rage. He was no man’s slave, and
there were bounds beyond which even a brother could step. He was on the point of
asking for time off to come to a definite, final settlement with the crowd when
the attempted shooting occurred. At first this cowardly deed only added to his
rage, but swiftly in its wake came unwonted gravity.</p>

<p>Disagreeable, even serious, as all those other persecutions had been, not one
of them held the weight of this last culminating effort to put Bob Bainbridge
out of the running. That Bill was mixed up in it Curly had no doubt, and the
realization frightened him. He had always looked up to his older brother with
admiration and a little awe, and he could not bear now to think of him mixed up
in anything so contemptible. There was the danger involved, too, and altogether
the youngster felt as if he must see Bill at once and try to make him cut the
gang and get away. His efforts might have no effect, but there was at least a
chance.</p>

<p>That night&mdash;or rather early in the morning, while it was still pitch
black&mdash;he slipped quietly out of camp without a word to any one. He reached
Lancaster at four in the afternoon, having made most of the journey in a scow
doing about six miles an hour. Going at once to the address given in the letter,
he found that his brother had gone out not fifteen minutes before.</p>

<p><q>Mebbe if you step in an’ wait he’ll be back soon,</q> suggested the slatternly
woman who kept the house.</p>

<p>Curly was shown to a room on the second floor back, where he recognized a
number of Bill’s belongings scattered about in the usual disorder. Perhaps it
was the sight of them which aroused in the young fellow an increasing doubt of
his ability to do what he came for. Would this man, who had never been in the
habit of taking any one’s advice, listen to him? He wondered, and then, unable
to remain still, arose and paced the floor anxiously.</p>

<p>Presently he dropped in a chair before a rough deal table, on top of which
was tacked a large sheet of blotting paper. A corner of white paper protruded
from beneath it, but Curly scarcely noticed this save as something to pluck at
nervously with thumb and forefinger. Finally he lighted the lamp, walked back
and forth some more, then relapsed into the chair again, resuming his absent
plucking of the paper beneath the blotter.</p>

<p>Ultimately, of course, he drew it gradually forth, and, catching a word or
two of writing, he did not hesitate to read the entire page.</p>

<p>It was a portion of a letter, both superscription and first page. Neither was
it signed. But there was enough in those few lines to make the riverman leap to
his feet with a startled cry of dismay.</p>

<p><q>Great guns!</q> he gasped. <q>Burn the mill&mdash;<em>our mill</em>? Well, I guess
not!</q></p>

<p>He carried the paper over to the light thinking that he might have made a
mistake. But it was plain enough.</p>

<blockquote>
<p style='text-indent:0'>Having received orders from me by wire in the manner above specified, you
will at once fire the mill in the manner discussed by us and decided upon by me
at our last meeting. There must be no delay in action. Neither should you step
before I order. This is of the greatest possible importance. Kindly advise me
you thoroughly understand these instructions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a minute or two Curly stood staring at this extraordinary fragment. Then
his gray eyes gleamed.</p>

<p><q>Gee!</q> he muttered. <q>I sure wish I could find the rest o’ this letter. It
sounds like it might be from that old skunk Crane that Bill’s so thick with, but
o’ course you never kin tell. It would certain be worth somethin’ to know for
sure.</q></p>

<p>Without hesitation he yanked up the blotter, tacks and all. There was nothing
underneath, so he next jerked forth the single drawer of the table, and dumped
out its contents. A search through these revealed nothing of interest and he
was about to replace the drawer when it occurred to him to thrust an inquiring
hand into the space back of it. His fingers encountered paper, and a moment
later his eyes gleamed with satisfaction as they rested on two envelopes
addressed to his brother in that same erect black writing which had
characterized the single sheet.</p>

<p><q>Got you this time, I reckon,</q> he muttered, in a tone of intense
satisfaction. <q>If Bainbridge ain’t interested in this&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p>He paused abruptly, and raised his head with a jerk, his eyes narrowing, and
his grip tightening unconsciously on the letters. From outside came a queer,
vibrating clang. For an instant he listened tensely as the sound rose and fell
on the night air, muffled a little by closed doors and windows, but still clear
and unmistakable&mdash;the primitive village fire alarm. With a gasp of dismay, he
leaped toward the door.</p>

<p><q>Cripes!</q> he cried, gripping the knob. <q>It’s to-night&mdash;to-night! An’ I never
guessed!</q></p>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV. FIRE AND SMOKE</h2>

<p>Curly found himself, hatless, and with two letters and a scrap of paper
clasped in one hand, running swiftly toward that portion of the riverbank where
stood the Bainbridge mill. What he could accomplish alone and unaided was a
question which troubled him vaguely. He meant, at least, to give the best that
was in him toward fighting a calamity he might have prevented if only he had
kept his wits about him.</p>

<p>Presently he slackened his pace a little, and a puzzled wrinkle came into his
forehead. There was not the slightest glare to be seen in the direction of the
mill. It seemed odd that a fire in such a place should not show itself sooner.
He hurried on a little farther, but still there was no sign of fire&mdash;no noise or
scurrying of people. At length, reaching the fence which surrounded mill and
lumber yards, he paused, wondering in which direction lay the nearest gate. A
second later, half turning, he saw the glow and sparks from a burning building
rising above the leafless trees at least a mile away.</p>

<p><q>Gee!</q> he muttered, in a tone of relief. <q>I’m sure glad I was fooled. For a
bit I thought it was all up, but now mebbe I kin put a crimp in their game.</q></p>

<p>He stood silent for a minute or two, turning the matter over in his mind.
There were difficulties which had not occurred to him at first. If he went to
Bainbridge or to the authorities with his discovery, Bill would be sure to pay
the penalty. He was not anxious for this. He did not want to mix his brother up
in the affair if it were possible to keep his name out of it. If he could only
see Bill he felt sure he could make him cut it all and get out of the country.
But that was the trouble&mdash;to find him and do it quickly. Where had he gone this
night of all others? What was keeping him away so long? Was it possible, after
all, that the burning <em>had</em> been planned for to-night, but planned to
take place later?</p>

<p>The interior of the inclosure seemed very quiet and peaceful, yet Curly felt
a fresh stab of apprehension when presently he discovered the big gate unlocked
and ajar. After a momentary hesitation he pushed the gate still farther open,
and, slipping through, closed it behind him, and crept, ghostlike, along in the
shadow of the fence.</p>

<p>Ahead loomed the mill buildings, velvet-black shadows against a blue-black
sky. To his left lay great stacks of manufactured lumber worth many thousand
dollars. He could not see them now, but he knew their location, and the thought
of all that property going up in smoke made him scowl fiercely, and clench his
fists in the darkness.</p>

<p>Presently he stopped abruptly as the blackness was pierced by a single gleam
of light from the corner of the shadowy building. The next instant he gave a
relieved chuckle. It came from the watchman’s shanty, of course. That was where
it stood, close by the corner of the main building.</p>

<p>Everything was so quiet and peaceful that it seemed futile to go any farther,
yet somehow the man wanted to make sure. Finally he decided to gain this end by
giving the watchman a tip about the gate.</p>

<p>Crossing the open space, he stepped to the window, and peered through the
dingy glass. The shack seemed empty; the lighted lantern stood on a rough table
from which a straight deal chair was pushed back. Yet, in spite of this, Curly
could not be quite certain, so he reached for the latch and thrust the door
open.</p>

<p>It was not empty. Some one&mdash;something was there, a huddled mass lying face
down in the corner. With a quick gasp of horror and alarm, Curly straightened and
whirled round.</p>

<p>Too late! Something heavy struck his head and pitched him, dazed, against the
wall of the shanty. He threw out both hands toward the shadows he could barely
see, and from his lips came a hoarse cry of mingled pain and fury. A second blow
beat through his guard, and stretched him senseless on the ground.</p>

<p>The coming around seemed to Curly merely a matter of seconds; really it must
have been much longer. When he recovered enough of his senses to make mental
notes he discovered that he was lying flat on the sawdust-covered floor near a
big circular saw that gleamed like burnished silver. He was bound round and
round with ropes, unable to move hand or foot. A lighted lantern made a bright
spot in the intense gloom, dimly revealing above him the heavy beams and rafters
of the mill. After a little he saw, sitting on the other side of the lantern, a
man who gazed steadily at him, and whose face, even in the shadows, seemed
familiar. A moment later he realized that the man was John Joyce.</p>

<p>The discovery was not a pleasant one. Joyce and he had been enemies for a
considerable time, owing mainly to the fact that both were paying attentions to
a certain young woman who showed decided partiality for Kollock. In a moment of
passion Joyce had sworn to <q>get</q> Curly, and the latter had jeered at him. He did
not jeer now. The best he could do was to summon a forced smile.</p>

<p><q>You’ll grin out o’ the other side of your mouth afore I git done with you,
you spyin’ scum,</q> observed the red-haired individual acrimoniously. <q>What are
you doin’ here?</q></p>

<p><q>None o’ your business!</q> retorted Kollock promptly. <q>Where’s Bill?</q></p>

<p><q>Better keep a civil tongue in your head,</q> snarled Joyce. <q>How come you
sneakin’ around this mill to-night? Who put you wise to what’s goin’ on?</q></p>

<p>Possessed of only a small fund of diplomacy, Curly saw a chance to make his
enemy writhe, and at once took it, regardless of all other considerations.</p>

<p><q>Never you mind who put me wise,</q> he retorted. <q>I’m on, all right. I know
you’re goin’ to set fire to the mill to-night, an’, what’s more, I know who put
you up to it&mdash;see? Git that through your dome? I’ve got evidence stowed away&mdash;in
a safe place, too&mdash;that’ll send somebody to Thomaston Prison for a nice little
bit. Get me?</q></p>

<p>All of this was not strictly true, but the young riverman could not pass up
the chance to make Joyce shiver. A moment later he more than regretted the
impulse.</p>

<p><q>Little Johnny-on-the-spot, ain’t you?</q> snarled the red-headed man, when he
had partially recovered from the shock. <q>You made a nice bull, though, exposin’
your cards before the show-down.</q></p>

<p>His jaws came together with a snap, and, rising suddenly to his feet, he
dropped on one knee beside Curly. In another second he had thrust a lump of
waste between the helpless riverman’s jaws, and tied it down with a dirty strip
of cloth. Then he resumed his seat.</p>

<p><q>Jest a little precaution against noise,</q> he said unpleasantly. <q>My pals are
out in the yard, an’ I ain’t anxious for ’em to know I brung you in here. They
think you’re a second watchman&mdash;see? I got sight o’ your face first an’ covered
it up so nobody would know you was here. Bill’s down to Lynchburg, soused, an’
likely won’t show up till mornin’. This was to be the night for our little
shindy, only, not havin’ no word yet, I was goin’ to give it up&mdash;till you come
along. Now I think I’ll let things go ahead, word or no word. Get me,
Steve?</q></p>

<p>He arose, leering hideously, and Curly felt the perspiration begin to burst
out all over his body. His wide-open eyes&mdash;the only part of him which could
move&mdash;sought Joyce’s, but the fellow’s gaze, shifting continually, thwarted the
attempt. Kollock noticed&mdash;just why he did not know&mdash;that the other’s face was
deathly pale, and that his low forehead was covered with little beads of sweat.
A second later Joyce picked up the lantern and moved lightly toward the
door.</p>

<p><q>Jest tell ’em that you saw me, an’ give ’em my regards,</q> he sneered over his
shoulder, but his voice cracked on the last word, and, stumbling over a loose
board in the floor, he disappeared.</p>

<p>For perhaps half a minute Curly lay absolutely still. Then the horror of what
that human fiend meant to do struck him with full force, turning him cold and
then hot as fire. He rolled over on his face, and, bracing both feet against the
foundation of the saw, strained the splendid muscles of back and arm and
shoulder as he had never strained them before. The ropes cracked a little, but
held fast, biting deep into his flesh. He paid no heed to the pain. Again he
strove with all his might to break those bonds. Again he failed. Joyce had done
his work well.</p>

<p>He was still straining, twisting, and flinging himself about till every inch
of his body seemed sore to the touch, when of a sudden the faint, light tang of
something new in the air made him stop like a person paralyzed.</p>

<p>Smoke!</p>

<p>For a second he did not dare to breathe. Slowly, fearfully, he drew in the
air. Then a smothered, inarticulate sound, half scream, half groan, echoed
through the dark mill. It was smoke! The coward had kept his word and fired the
building. No one would ever know. The flames were coming fast&mdash;fast. Presently
they would reach him&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>In a panic of horror he again cast himself here and there over the board
floor, the sawdust sometimes muffling the thudding sound of his body. There was
not one chance in a thousand that one would hear him. He stopped and listened,
but detected no sound. A fresh puff of smoke made him gag. It was coming faster
and faster, thicker and thicker.</p>

<p>Gasping for breath, he flung himself about again in a mad paroxysm of fear.
Above the thudding noise of his own making he could hear the horrible, ominous
crackling of flames. Crevices here and there began to be outlined in dull,
glowing, changing red. He thought he heard the clanging of the primitive alarm,
but he could not be sure.</p>

<p>Hither and thither he rolled, keeping up the motion without conscious
volition, scraping, scratching, bumping against obstacles, but always blindly to
get farther away from the consuming element beyond the partition.</p>

<p>At one time the lapping, gurgling sound of water struck on his dazed senses
with the shock of the incredible. Then he realized that it came from beneath
him, and knew that he must be in the portion of the mill built out over the
river. A few inches of flooring was all that separated him from the cool,
soothing touch of that water. The bitter irony of it ate into his soul like
caustic, and brought a sudden rush of scalding tears to the stinging,
smoke-blinded eyes.</p>

<p>The glow brightened, grew more vivid. A single tongue of flame slid through a
crack, and began licking up the wall. The sight seemed to arouse Curly to fresh
exertions. He flung himself furiously to one side, and by a strange chance he
struck glancingly against the teeth of the circular saw, which cut his face
cruelly and tore away the gag.</p>

<p>It took him a second or two to realize what had happened. Then from between
his swollen lips a fierce, wild cry of desperate appeal rang out. It rose
shrilly, piercingly, ended in a choke. He tried to cry again, but the smoke
rushed into his lungs and turned the shout into a gruesome groan.</p>

<p>That smoke was pouring into the room in clouds now. The single tongue of
flame had bred a score, casting a lurid light over the place, and driving black
despair into the half-conscious brain of the hopeless victim.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XV. THE WAY OUT</h2>

<p>Bob Bainbridge came down to Lancaster that same evening. He had made
arrangements with Tweedy to be there at a certain hour to receive the wire his
partner planned to send regarding a loan necessary to cover that second note.
Arriving in town about a quarter to Bob went straight to the telegraph office.
The operator, a dapper youth of almost tender years, promptly handed him an
envelope.</p>

<p><q>Came in just in time, Mr. Bainbridge,</q> he announced. <q>We close at six, you
know.</q></p>

<p>Bob nodded absently without speaking, and departed at once for the hotel he
usually patronized. There would be plenty of time in the morning to send his
partner an answer, and he was anxious to have a chance to think the matter over
quietly.</p>

<p>Reaching the hotel, he registered, and went at once to the room assigned him.
Here he opened the message, and read it through with a perfectly blank
expression:</p>

<blockquote>
<p style='text-indent:0'>Have cover removed on tank house. Can’t use other timber.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><q>Well, I’ll be hanged!</q> Bainbridge exclaimed aloud. <q>What the deuce does that
mean? <q>Have cover removed on tank house. Can’t use other timber.</q> Blamed if I
think it means anything. Sounds like gibberish to me.</q></p>

<p>Puzzled, and decidedly ill-tempered, he sat down and scanned the message
closely. He could not believe it had been sent him as a joke. Tweedy was not the
sort to perpetrate that kind of a pleasantry, especially at present. But what
else could it be?</p>

<p>For twenty minutes or more he sat staring at the sheet before he made a
curious discovery. The telegram was not addressed to him at all, but to one
William Kollock.</p>

<p><q>The genial Bill,</q> he muttered, his eyes sparkling with a new interest.
<q>Jove! The plot thickens!</q></p>

<p>A glance at the envelope showed his own name written plainly thereon.
Evidently the boy had carelessly transposed the messages, giving Bainbridge the
one intended for the tool of his bitterest enemy. To Bob the annoyance of
realizing that, in all probability, Kollock was in possession of Tweedy’s wire
about the loan was swallowed up in the interest of those ten words before
him.</p>

<p>That they were written in a secret code Bainbridge had not a doubt. There was
a superficial coherency about them, but when one studied the message, the
impossibility of a careless operator being responsible for those errors became
plain. Just what that code might be Bob did not know, but he meant to find out
if such a thing were possible. A cryptogram addressed to Bill Kollock must,
almost certainly, be of vital importance to himself.</p>

<p>The reading of the ciper&mdash;if such it could be called&mdash;proved ever simpler
than he had expected. Taking the first letters of each word from left to right
made no sense at all. Reversing the process, however, produced this cryptic
phrase:</p>

<p><q>Touch torch.</q></p>

<p><q>About as dotty as the other.</q> grumbled Bob, crumpling the message into a
pocket. <q>I’m hanged if I’ll bother with the thing any longer.</q></p>

<p>He could not help thinking about it, however, and after a futile walk to the
telegraph office, and equally futile attempt to locate the operator, he went
back to the hotel and turned in.</p>

<p>But even here his mind refused to respond to the urgings of his tired body.
Though he did best to forget those two tantalizing words, he found it
impossible. What did they mean? What <em>could</em> they mean? Perhaps, after all, they
meant nothing in themselves, but were simply a cryptic sort of signal which the
recipient alone would understand.</p>

<p><q>Touch torch,</q> he murmured drowsily, as he stretched his weary body
luxuriously on the first real bed he had known in months. <q>What the deuce! Touch
torch&mdash;&mdash;Great guns! The mill!</q></p>

<p>With a single bound he cleared the space between bed and bureau. In a second
the lamp was lighted, and he was flinging on his clothes in mad haste. What a
thick-headed fool he had been! That was it, of course! Thwarted in those other
cowardly attacks, it was the most natural thing in the world for Elihu Crane to
make use of this means of crippling his competitor. He who had not hesitated at
attempted assassination was not likely to stop at arson.</p>

<p>Within five minutes Bainbridge had left the hotel, and was tearing down the
road in the direction of his property. The sky was still dark and placid, and
for a little while he thought he would be in time. But as he reached the fence
surrounding the mill, and ran along it toward the nearest gates, a sudden
reddish glow flashed up through the blackness beyond the high board structure,
followed by a little shower of sparks like a feathery rocket.</p>

<p>Without pausing an instant in his rush, Bainbridge drew his revolver and
fired twice in the air. Then he broke the stillness with a cry of fire from his
powerful lungs&mdash;a cry which might almost have raised the dead.</p>

<p>The gates were wide open, and, as he raced through into the inclosure, he
almost collided with a shadowy figure, bent over, and running with long, agile
strides. The pistol was still in Bob’s hand, and, without a moment of
hesitation, he sent it crashing square in the middle of the unknown’s forehead,
dropping the fellow like a log.</p>

<p><q>One good thing done, anyhow,</q> muttered Bainbridge, with a fierce kind of
satisfaction.</p>

<p>He hesitated an instant, wondering whether to pause and make the fellow
secure, or hurry on toward the burning building. Brief as had been the space
since it first showed, the fire was beginning to break forth, illumining the
sky, and making the mill seem almost like a flaming furnace within. There was
little chance of accomplishing any good there, while it would be a pity if one
of the undoubted criminals escaped.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind, and was searching through his pockets for something
to bind the fellow with, when a scream rang out, so wild and full of agonized
appeal that it chilled his blood. It came from the burning building, and in an
instant Bob was running toward it with all his might.</p>

<p>He raced around a corner, peering through windows as he ran. The front half
of the building was one glare of flaming crimson, in which no human being could
live a minute. The man&mdash;it was the watchman, of course&mdash;must be in the rear.</p>

<p>He kept on around. Reaching another window, he smashed it with a piece of
<q>edging</q> caught up from the ground, letting out a volume of smoke. With a bound
he was inside, facing the glare which came from the billowing mass of fire.</p>

<p><q>Tom!</q> he cried, shielding his face with one crooked arm. <q>Tom! Where are
you?</q></p>

<p>There was no answer. Crouching low and holding his breath, he hurried toward
a portion of the mill which overlooked the river. Behind him the flames closed
in with chuckling crackles like sentient things of murderous intent bent on
cutting off his retreat.</p>

<p><q>Tom!</q> he cried again. <q>Where are&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p>The words died in his throat. Sprawled across the log carrier near one of the
huge circular saws was the inert body of a man. The fire had almost reached it,
but Bainbridge plunged forward without faltering. Through heat that singed hair
and eyebrows, and seemed to sear his lungs with the breath of death he plunged.
Stooping, he grasped the unconscious man by the shoulders, and dragged him
across the floor. He could not retreat as he had come. He did not try. He was
making for the opening to the runway or chute over which logs were yanked up
from the river. This was rather steep and slippery, and he was forced to change
his grip on the man. An instant later he gave a cry of amazement as he
recognized the blackened, bloody features of his own riverman.</p>

<p>But there was not a second to lose in speculation as to what Curly was doing
here. The glare of the burning building lit up the whole river, and already from
the other side came cries of arriving villagers. He could see them running;
doubtless many of them saw him as he paused in the fire-lit arch of the chute
with the unconscious youth in his arms.</p>

<p><q>It’s a swim for it,</q> he muttered, glancing at Kollock. <q>Not much of a one,
but mighty cold. Reckon we’ll be on our way.</q></p>

<p>Hoisting Kollock over his shoulder, he stepped into the log-polished trough.
For a fraction of a second he seemed to stand motionless, straight as a dart, a
striking figure against that background of lurid crimson. Then, still remaining
upright, he shot downward at an angle like a person sliding on ice, to plunge
with a great splash into the icy water.</p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XVI. THE VERGE OF RUIN</h2>

<p>Stepping hastily from his car, John Tweedy hurried across the sidewalk, and
entered the lobby of the Bangor House. His plump face had an oddly sunken, pasty
look. The jowls were pendulous, and there were dark rings under the eyes. His
whole manner, in fact, was that of a man on the verge of a nervous collapse,
holding himself together by sheer determination of will.</p>

<p>Inside the door he paused a moment, staring almost furtively to right and
left, as if the ruin he knew to be so imminent was already a matter of public
knowledge and comment. The fairly well-filled lobby held a number of familiar
faces, whose owners either did not or would not see the stout man. Tweedy made
sure that the slight was intentional, and a nervous tremor quivered on his
lips.</p>

<p><q>Bah!</q> he muttered, hastening on toward the desk, <q>They’re beginning to cut
me. After the fire last night they think I’m out for more credit. It’s the
beginning of the end.</q></p>

<p>To his supersensitive mind the very desk clerk, who had so often laughed
obsequiously at the lumber magnate’s jokes and pocketed with effusive thanks his
expensive cigars, delayed purposely in attending him. It was the subtle
impertinence of an inferior which seems to cut so much more deeply than any
other kind, and it stung Tweedy into a momentary flash of his old spirit.</p>

<p><q>Griggs!</q> he snapped, in a voice which brought the clerk instantly forward.
<q>I have an appointment to meet Mr. Bainbridge here at twelve,</q> he went on,
transfixing the young man with an icy stare. <q>Has he left any word for me?</q></p>

<p>Before the flushed, embarrassed youth could answer, a hand dropped lightly on
Tweedy’s shoulder, and a cheery, familiar voice sounded in his ear:</p>

<p><q>Well, John, you’re certainly on the dot. Put it there, old man! I’m mighty
glad to see you.</q></p>

<p>It was Bob, clean, fresh, and well groomed. His eyes sparkled, the glow of
health was in his cheeks. There was an air of vigor and physical fitness about
him which made Tweedy stare in bewilderment, wondering whether his partner was
made of iron.</p>

<p><q>I’m certainly glad to see you, Bobby,</q> he echoed, gripping the strong, brown
fingers. <q>I don’t know how you can stand the pace, though. I’m about all in
sitting up most of the night trying to figure out our losses from the
incomplete&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>Just one second, John,</q> interrupted Bainbridge, and only then was his
partner aware of the pleasant-faced, rather distinguished-appearing, gray-haired
man who stood just behind the young lumberman. <q>I want you to meet Mr. Wolcott
Sears, of Boston. He’s been up in the woods fishing, and we got acquainted up
there.</q></p>

<p>Tweedy acknowledged the introduction with the best grace he could summon, in
view of the fact that he was burning to get Bob by himself, and find out
something of where the firm stood. He knew Sears by reputation as an influential
and powerful capitalist, and it was his policy always to be agreeable to moneyed
men. But even that, combined with the Boston man’s undoubted charm of manner,
did not prevent Tweedy from being a trifle austere. He only thawed completely
when Sears presently announced that he would have to tear himself away at once,
or else miss the Boston train.</p>

<p><q>I was afraid he’d stick around for hours,</q> Tweedy said, as Bob returned from
seeing Sears to the door. <q>Let’s go over here where there’s less crowd.</q></p>

<p><q>Couldn’t have a better man,</q> said Bob, falling into step with his partner.
<q>He’s one of the best ever, John, and has been a good friend to me.</q></p>

<p><q>Of course, of course!</q> returned Tweedy, with a nervous sort of pettishness.
<q>That’s all very well, but we don’t want anybody else around just now. Tell me
about the mill. Complete loss, I suppose?</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge nodded. <q>Just about. Saved a few hundred thousand feet of pine
stacked at the upper end of the yard. Everything else went.</q></p>

<p>A facial muscle quivered, as if the confirmation of what Tweedy had feared,
yet hoped desperately against, had touched a raw nerve. He dropped down in one
of the row of leather-covered chairs facing Main Street, and took out his
handkerchief.</p>

<p><q>My country!</q> he groaned, staring in bewilderment at his companion. <q>I don’t
see how you can take it all so easy. You know as well as I do that there’s not a
cent of insurance on the stock. You must realize that Lancaster was the only
mill we had capable of taking care of a big drive.</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge sat on the arm of the adjoining chair, one leg lightly swinging
back and forth.</p>

<p><q>That’s true enough,</q> he nodded, feeling for his cigarette case. <q>I’ve always
contended, though, that with proper equipment, the mill at Colport could turn
out a third more cut lumber than the Lancaster mill.</q></p>

<p>Tweedy groaned, and cast up his eyes. <q>What if it could?</q> he demanded. <q>How
in creation are we going to find out? We’re broke&mdash;busted&mdash;cleaned out!</q> Even in
the stress of his emotion he remembered to lower his voice cautiously. <q>We’ve
hardly an asset left except the drive. We’ve no credit. One of our notes for
eight thousand dollars is due in less than twenty-four hours&mdash;due to the very
scoundrel who’s brought us where we are, and whose plotting won’t stop
there.</q></p>

<p>At last he seemed to find a shaft capable of penetrating the armor of Bob’s
self-possession. With a start, the young man dropped the match, and stared
fixedly at Tweedy, the fresh-lighted cigarette dangling unheeded between the
fingers of his other hand.</p>

<p><q>Crane?</q> he exclaimed sharply. <q>You mean to say he’s bought up that
note?</q></p>

<p><q>Precisely.</q></p>

<p><q>Huh!</q> Bainbridge lifted the cigarette, and took a thoughtful puff or two.
<q>That must be why he sent the message I found here a little while ago. Said if I
was quite ready to crawl he’d be in his office till two this afternoon.</q></p>

<p>He hesitated a second longer, and then stood up with a sudden, determined
squaring of his wide shoulders.</p>

<p><q>How about it, John?</q> he asked, a curious gleam in the dark eyes. <q>What do
you say to making a call on the genial Elihu?</q></p>

<p>Tweedy rose heavily. <q>I give up.</q> he said, with a deep sigh. <q>Do as you like,
son, it’s all one to me. Only don’t for an instant expect any from Elihu Crane.
Personally I’d rather spare myself the humiliation of an interview which can
result in no possible good, but if you’re keen on it&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p>He finished with an eloquent gesture of resignation which brought a sudden
softness into the young man’s eyes.</p>

<p><q>By Jove, but you’re a sport!</q> he exclaimed, with a touch of his hand on the
other’s shoulder, which was almost a caress. <q>Don’t you care, though, old man.
It won’t take long, and I’ll attend to the talk. All you’ll have to do will be
to furnish me with the moral support of your presence.</q></p>
</div>

<div class='chapter'>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII. THE VISIT TO ELIHU</h2>

<p>For so many years Elihu Crane had preserved his impassive demeanor in public
that he gradually ceased to let down the bars at all. Even in his own
office&mdash;that inner sanctum which he had made as difficult of access as the
specie vault of the Bank of England&mdash;he retained his pose. At this particular
moment, even, holding in his hand that slip of paper which was the strongest
thread in the web he had been weaving so long and patiently about his hated
competitors, his face revealed nothing of the fierce joy which filled his
soul.</p>

<p>That paper was the note which fell due upon the morrow. Bainbridge &amp;
Tweedy could not meet it, he was certain. Their funds were exhausted; their
credit gone. Barring a miracle, he held them in his power at last. He meant to
exercise that power ruthlessly and without mercy.</p>

<p>There was one little carping doubt in his mind&mdash;though that, too, was hidden
behind the impenetrable mask. Was he to be deprived, after all, of the keen
pleasure he had planned for himself&mdash;the pleasure of being the one imparting to
young Bainbridge by word of mouth the exact status of his affairs, and a
gloating account of what the future held in store?</p>

<p>His letter had been placed in Bainbridge’s hands hours before. Bob was not
obliged to come, but Crane had written with a perfect knowledge of the young
man’s nature, coupled with all the diabolical cunning he possessed. It would be
strange if the combination did not serve to goad the high-spirited youngster
into doing what his former partner desired, and yet the minute hand of the clock
was climbing swiftly upward from half past one, and there had come no word.</p>

<p>Frowning the least bit, Crane at length stretched out a lean, wrinkled hand
toward one of a row of pearl-topped buttons set in the surface of the flat
mahogany desk. Almost as he did so one of the telephones at his left tinkled
lightly, and he lifted it swiftly. A brief conversation took place which
smoothed miraculously the forehead of the Lumber Trust official.</p>

<p><q>Show them in at once, Banning,</q> he finished.</p>

<p>Setting down the instrument, he leaned back, eyes fixed on the door with a
touch almost of pleasurable anticipation in them. When presently it swung open
to admit Bob Bainbridge, followed closely by Tweedy, Crane’s mouth tightened
cruelly, and the sandy-fringed lids drooped a trifle.</p>

<p><q>And so,</q> he said at length, his lips curling, <q>you’ve come to crawl.</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge did not answer for a moment. He was busy settling down in the
chair which had not been offered him, and in seeing that Tweedy did the same.
Then he drew out a cigar case and, with elaborate courtesy, extended it to
Crane.</p>

<p><q>No?</q> he murmured, as the latter declined with a brief gesture. <q>Given up
smoking? Here, John.</q></p>

<p>When Tweedy had accepted, and his own weed was lighted, Bainbridge leaned
comfortably back in his chair.</p>

<p><q>To crawl?</q> he repeated slowly, <q>Well, I don’t know about that. A fellow
never likes to crawl if there’s another way out of a difficulty.</q></p>

<p>Crane’s eyes glinted. <q>Rest assured there isn’t,</q> he retorted crisply.
<q>You’re in a hole. You haven’t a single resource left. Your credit’s no
good.</q></p>

<p><q>Oh, I don’t admit that,</q> put in Bob hastily.</p>

<p><q>Whether you admit it or not, it’s true,</q> retorted Crane, a note of cold,
calculating triumph creeping into his voice. <q>You can’t bluff me. I’ve had a man
looking up your affairs for some time, and I know what I’m talking about.
Tweedy, here, has been breaking his neck all last week trying to borrow enough
to meet your note of eight thousand which is due at noon to-morrow. That
note</q>&mdash;he bent forward, and raised for an instant the oblong sheet of paper from
his desk&mdash;<q>is here.</q></p>

<p>If he expected signs of surprise or consternation from Bainbridge he was
disappointed. Bob simply crossed one leg over the other, and nodded.</p>

<p><q>So I understand,</q> he drawled.</p>

<p>There was a briefest sort of pause, during which his dark eyes held the older
man’s in thrall. Suddenly he arose.</p>

<p><q>You may as well hand it over now,</q> he said coolly, moving toward the
desk.</p>

<p>In a twinkling Crane had acted. With amazing agility he bent forward over the
desk. A buzzer sounded. A drawer popped open. A second later he had snatched
from it a revolver, which he leveled swiftly at Bob. Last of all, doors at
either end of the office opened noiselessly to admit a pair of stalwart
attendants.</p>

<p>Bainbridge, pausing in the middle of the floor, surveyed these maneuvers with
interest and frank amusement.</p>

<p><q>Very clever and effective,</q> he murmured slowly, exhaling a whiff of smoke.
<q>Plainly no one’s ever going to catch you napping. It happens, though, that I
had no idea of playing the holdup game. I wished merely to hand you a check for
the amount of that note and interest, and cancel it. Would you mind turning that
barrel just a trifle to one side? Accidents will happen, you know, and your
staff here seems quite able to cope with the situation alone.</q></p>

<p>A single momentary flash of incredulous anger ripped across Crane’s
impassive countenance. Then the mask fell again, and, lowering the revolver, he
bent forward.</p>

<p><q>You certainly don’t expect me to accept a personal check of yours for that
amount, do you?</q> he inquired coldly.</p>

<p><q>Not quite,</q> smiled Bainbridge. <q>Knowing your skeptical nature, I took the
trouble to have it certified.</q></p>

<p>He drew out his bill case, and, taking from it a narrow slip of paper, laid
it before Crane. Silence followed&mdash;tense, vibrating with something of the sense
of that bitter, baffled fury which was rending the older man as he stared at the
scrap of paper that was depriving him of his revenge. It was the equivalent of
currency. He could not refuse to take it. The amount was correct to the last
cent. The whole transaction was one in which even his cunning could find no
flaw.</p>

<p>But where had the money come from? He could not believe that any one in
Bangor had supplied it. It was impossible that his subordinates could have been
so deceived.</p>

<p>With swiftly growing fury Crane made a brief note of payment on the back of
the paper. His hand trembled. By the time the signature was written his lips
were quivering&mdash;his face dark.</p>

<p><q>There!</q> he rasped harshly, thrusting the note at Bainbridge. <q>Where you got
it I don’t know, but it’ll do you no good. Your best mill’s a total loss. You
haven’t sold a foot of lumber in weeks, and you won’t for months to come.
Everybody’s bought what they want from us at easy rates. You may think this is a
mighty smart move, but I’ll get you in the end!</q></p>

<p><q>I think not!</q></p>

<p>Bob’s voice had taken on a sudden quality of hardness. His face lost the
half-bantering expression of a moment before, and grew coldly stern. It was as
if he had all at once wearied of the little drama he had been staging, and was
determined to ring down the curtain without delay.</p>

<p><q>I think not,</q> he repeated curtly. <q>Who did you make those biggest sales of
cut-rate lumber to, Crane?</q></p>

<p>There was an underlying significance in his tone which made Crane glance
sharply at him from under penthouse brows, and then dismiss the two silent
attendants with a gesture.</p>

<p><q>What business is that of yours?</q> he demanded.</p>

<p>Bainbridge laughed harshly, triumphantly, <q>What business is it of mine? I’ll
tell you.</q></p>

<p>He bent suddenly forward, gripping the edge of the desk with both hands. His
face was slightly flushed; his eyes, fixed intently on Crane, held in their
depths a gleam of singularly disconcerting triumph.</p>

<p><q>I’ll tell you,</q> he said rapidly. <q>J. G. Brown, of Porltand, had two million
feet, didn’t he? Creighton, of Rockland, bought half as much. There was Cox, of
Portsmouth&mdash;Blanchard&mdash;Manning&mdash;Lafitte. You see, I <em>know</em>!</q></p>

<p>There was a ring in his voice which made Tweedy begin to tingle and sit
forward, suddenly erect, in thrilling anticipation of the bombshell he felt sure
was coming.</p>

<p><q>Why don’t you ask the questions you’re dying to? How? Why? You’re wild to
know; I can see it in your eyes.</q> Bob laughed again, and Crane winced at the
sound. <q>I’ll tell you. I know because they’re only my
agents&mdash;buying&mdash;for&mdash;me!</q></p>

<p><q>It’s a lie!</q> burst from Crane’s white lips. <q>They paid cash! You haven’t a
cent.</q></p>

<p><q>I have something better&mdash;unlimited credit. Shall I tell you who’s backing me
because he hates the trust, and has faith in my ability to fight you? Wolcott
Sears, of Boston. Now do you understand? Instead of ruining us by cutting rates,
you’ve played straight into our hands. Timber values can’t go down. We’ll sell
at market prices what we bought from you and clean up a cool half million on
the deal.</q></p>

<p>With an inarticulate cry of fury, Crane leaped to his feet, and stood glaring
at Bainbridge with flaming, maddened eyes. The mask of inscrutability had
vanished from his face. One saw the real man now, stripped of the veneer of
temperament and civilization.</p>

<p><q>It’s a plot!</q> he raved, shaking a skinny fist in Bob’s face. <q>It’s a vile
conspiracy. I’ll take the case to court. I’ll have you jailed for&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>

<p><q>Sit down!</q></p>

<p>Bainbridge’s tone was not loud, but there was a compelling quality about it
which stopped the boiling torrent of fury with amazing suddenness. Crane gulped
hard, caught his trembling lips between his teeth&mdash;and finally subsided into his
chair.</p>

<p><q>You talk of plots&mdash;you!</q> The young man’s voice was hard, cold, full of
unutterable contempt. <q>Do you happen to know the penalty for conspiracy to
commit arson&mdash;and worse?</q></p>

<p><q>I don’t know&mdash;what you mean,</q> faltered Crane, avoiding the dark eyes bent so
keenly on his face.</p>

<p><q>Oh, yes, you do. Look at these.</q></p>

<p>With a swift, dramatic motion Bainbridge suddenly jerked from his pocket some
sheets of paper covered closely with erect, spitefully black writing, and held
them before Crane.</p>

<p><q>Your own hand,</q> he accused. <q>Instructions to your henchman, Bill Kollock? I
think the jury at your trial will consider them proof enough.</q></p>

<p>Crane’s jaw dropped. His white face had turned a sickly green.</p>

<p><q>You&mdash;wouldn’t&mdash;dare!</q> he gasped.</p>

<p><q>Wouldn’t I? Just let me show you.</q></p>

<p>Without waiting a reply, Bob leaned over, and, picking up one of the
telephones, stood erect.</p>

<p><q>Headquarters,</q> he said briefly. Then, after a momentary pause: <q>That you,
chief? This is Bainbridge. Will you send up those two plain-clothes men we
arranged about? Yes, the arrest can be made any time. That’s all. Thank
you!</q></p>

<p>The receiver clicked into place again, and Bainbridge returned the instrument
to the desk. Crane sat hunched in his chair, his face a mixture of hate and fear
and baffled fury. Tweedy looked as if a mammoth weight had been suddenly lifted
from his shoulders. Bob’s expression was inscrutable.</p>

<p>The room was very still.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
